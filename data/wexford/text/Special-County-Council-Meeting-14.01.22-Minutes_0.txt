County Council Meeting 14.01.22 

 1. 

Vote of Sympathy 

On the proposal of the Cathaoirleach, seconded by Cllr. J. Sullivan, the Members 
unanimously resolved to pass a Vote of Sympathy to the Murphy Family of Cully, Blueball, 
County Offaly, following the recent tragic death of Ms. Aisling Murphy. 

A Minute’s Silence was observed. 

2. 

Consideration of the Report of the Investigation by the Standards in Public Office 
Commission of Alleged Contraventions of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and 2001 
and Part 15 of the Local Government Act 2001 - Mr. Tom Enright, Chief Executive, 
Wexford County Council 

The Council invited the Chief Executive to make a submission in respect of the above 
Report. In response, Mr. Enright referenced his submission as circulated earlier to the 
Elected Members, and briefly summarised the contents for the Member’s information and 
consideration.  

In his submission Mr. Enright categorically stated his belief that he acted at all times in 
good faith and expressed his regret for the tone of the emails which were the subject of 
the SIPO Report. The CE also confirmed that while he did not agree with much of SIPO’s 
findings, he accepted them and the role of SIPO and confirmed his intention not to 
challenge the SIPO findings.   

There followed a lengthy discussion to which many members contributed. Members spoke 
positively about the Chief Executive’s contribution to the Council and to the County, with 
many expressing the view that Mr. Enright had acted in good faith at all times and in the 
best interests of the Council.  

Cllr. T. Forde questioned the appropriateness of correspondence received by the Council 
members on the previous day from a member of the Oireachtas, seeking to influence the 
decision of the Members on this issue. 

Cllr. P. Barden expressed his concern that the time period between the date of the SIPO 
report and the decision of the Council was very short and did not afford the members 
sufficient time in which to consider the SIPO report and subsequent submission of the 
Chief Executive. 

The majority of Members confirmed they had considered the Report and the submission of 
Mr. Enright and were satisfied that they were in a position to proceed to a decision as 
provided for in the relevant legislation.

The Cathaoirleach then advised the members that she proposed to invite Mr. Lannigan, 
Legal Advisor, to advise the Council on the various matters raised. In response, Mr. 
Lannigan indicated he was happy to do so, but he indicated that it was appropriate that 
such advice be offered to the Members only, as they were his clients in the matter. 

On the proposal of the Cathaoirleach, seconded by Cllr. Carthy, the Council resolved to 
adjourn the meeting for a period to allow the Members to be briefed by Mr. Lannigan.  
The Council then adjourned and all attendees other than the Elected Members withdrew. 

The adjournment lasted approximately 30 minutes and the meeting then reconvened. 

Cllr. O. Walsh proposed that the Council, having considered the Sipo Report and having 
invited a submission from Mr. Enright on the matter and having considered same, resolve 
to note the Report and to take no further action in the matter. 

Cllr. Walsh’s proposal was seconded by Cllr. P. Breen. There were no further proposals. 

It was agreed to vote on the proposal by way of roll-call, and the results of that roll-call are 
recorded below:
