15.6 Councillor J. Mythen:

received same.

rehoused or be allowed to continue their tenancy in the residence”.

“As a critical means of job creation and infrastructure enhancement,  this Council reaffirms 
our support for the introduction and continued rollout of natural gas to County Wexford and

urban areas of the County”.

Cllr. J. Browne, Cllr. M. Sheehan: 

"That Wexford County Council calls on the government to compel commercial business in 
the food sector to donate unsold but edible food in the first instance to charity, and then for 
use as animal feed or compost in the event that the food is unsafe for human consumption. 

In a time where 10pc of the population suffers from food poverty we are sending 1,000,000 
tonnes of food to waste yearly, about 30-40% of what is produced. There are about 750,000 
tonnes of organic waste generated each year by businesses in Ireland. Of this, over 
300,000 comes from commercial businesses (e.g. food retail, hotels, food wholesale, 
hospitals, restaurants, etc.) and over 400,000 tonnes is generated by the industrial food 
producing sector".

Development SPC.

Cllr. J. Browne, Cllr. F. Kehoe: 

"That Wexford County Council implement a policy of facilitating the conversion of heating 
systems in its housing units to allow multi source heating to include the use of solid fuel 
stoves for its tenants on a needs basis. 

The use of solid fuel stoves aids the elevation of fuel poverty for those who cannot afford an 
oil supply, fuel poverty in turn increases socio-economic depravation and debilitates health 
while stoves are environmentally more efficient than open fires". 

This motion was agreed and referred to the Housing SPC to deal with the details.

communities all over Ireland with almost 3 million members and nearly 400 offices 
nationally;

almost 10,000 volunteers; 

— credit unions have survived the crisis well with just 1% of credit unions needing State 
funding support since the financial crisis began;  

— the not-for-profit and independent nature of credit unions is vital to the success of the 
sector; 

— in other jurisdictions, the role and function of credit unions is clearly set out at a national 
policy level; 

— the sector is overburdened with restrictive limitations which are disproportionate to the 
nature of its lending and this is stifling the growth potential of credit unions;”

Cllr. M. Byrne: 
“That all development plans for Co. Wexford would ensure that no new fast food 
restaurant or outlet could open within 500m of any school”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne, seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding, and 
carried with all Members present voting in favour.  The Director for Planning noted the 
intent of this motion and stated that every effort will be made to ensure that the spirit of 
the motion is incorporated into future development plans but noted that achieving this 
objective would be problematic in town centre environments.  

Cllr. A. Kelly: 
“I move, that this Council would call on the Minister for Health to make funds available 
for the setting up of a 24/7 adequately staffed acute mental health assessment unit in 
Wexford”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. A. Kelly, seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding.  The 
motion was carried unanimously by the Council. 

Cllr. J. Browne: 
“That this Council calls on Pobal to pay to the minimum wage to employees in the 
community it supports though its various programmes and condemns its refusal to do 
so."  

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Browne, seconded by Cllr. J. Mythen and 
agreed by the Council.  It was agreed that “Pobal” be replaced by “Department of Social 
Protection”. 

Cllr. J. Browne: 
“That this council writes to The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural 
Resources, Alex White, T.D. and calls on him to speed up the roll out of high speed 
broadband in order to end the digital divide between major urban centres and rural 
areas. Access to high-quality broadband allows people to live and work where they 
choose and has become critical to efficient farming. The lack of high speed broadband 
in areas of County Wexford is contributing significantly to its economic malaise.” 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Browne, seconded by Cllr. R. Ireton and 
agreed unanimously by the Council.

Cllr. M. Byrne: 
“That Wexford Council, recognising that the vast majority of Councillors in Ireland are 
hardworking and committed to their communities and do not abuse their public office, 
does not condone the actions of any public representative or official that engages in any 
form of corrupt practice or abuse of their office and calls for the following - 

- a strengthening of the law to take action against any representative or official found 
guilty of corrupt practices, abuse of office for personal gain and serious tax evasion, 
such sanction including suspension or removal from their office 
- the establishment of a national anti- corruption office to address any allegations of 
abuse 
- a streamlining of the declaration requirements of public representatives such that each 
public representative must only have to fill in one single form each year and that such 
information can be done online and easily accessible. 

And, pending national action is this area, that the Council will publish all Councillors' 
declarations of interests on our website each year”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne, seconded by Cllr. A. Kelly and 
agreed unanimously by the Members.   

Motion from the Economic SPC Chairman Michael Sheehan: 

“As per the recommendation of the Economic Strategic Policy Committee, we 
recommend that Wexford County Council calls on SIRO, (the joint venture Broadband 
Company) to ensure that the all four district Towns and the Rural Areas are included in 
the first wave of their Broadband programme and that SIRO publishes a timeframe for 
installation in County Wexford”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Sheehan, seconded by Cllr. L. O’Brien and
