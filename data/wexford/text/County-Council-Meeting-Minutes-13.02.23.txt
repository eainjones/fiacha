Together National School. We ask that the Department begin to engage meaningfully with

Response of the Executive: 

If passed, this Motion will be forwarded to the Minister for Education, for consideration. 

The motion was proposed by Cllr. L. Kelly, seconded by Cllr. G. Lawlor and carried. 

13.3    Motion passed at Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment SPC 17.11.2022 

“Requesting a Special Meeting of the Full Council on the whole issue of coastal erosion, 
flooding and rising sea levels as most districts have a problem in this regard with land being 
lost or flooding problems. “ 

Response of the Executive: 

If passed, the Executive will liaise with the Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment 
SPC and the Environment Department to facilitate a special meeting, as outlined. 

The motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Farrell, seconded by Cllr. J. Moore and carried. 

13.4 Cllr. J. Fleming 

"I am calling on Wexford county council to implement the following policy, when Wexford 
county council purchase turn key developments or lease from an approved housing body 
that at least 15% of the properties have disability (wheel chair accessible ) bathrooms on 
the ground floor .” 

Response of the Executive: 

Wexford County Council has included the following priority in our Strategic Plan for 
Housing Persons with Disabilities 2021-2026, County Wexford Housing and Disability 
Steering Group: 

"Local Authority Turnkey acquisitions have increasingly become a method of social housing 
delivery in recent years.  Where Wexford County Council acquires an entire development, 
20% of units are required to be adaptable in line with the County Development Plan. 
Where only a percentage of units are being acquired the Local Authority should seek to 
acquire adaptable units where possible (subject to unit size and cost). There should also be 
an increased awareness relayed to developers around the need for adaptable units”. 

Policy objective 9 of the Housing Strategy in the Wexford County Development Plan 2022 – 
2028 states “To promote Universal Design and Lifetime Housing standards in new homes 
built in the County in accordance with best practice. Significant developments of new 
homes shall ensure that a minimum of 20% of dwellings are suitable to accommodate or 
are adaptable to provide accommodation for people with disabilities. Developers will be

County Council Meeting 13.02.23 

required to show an accessible route to the residential units from the boundary of the 
property. Proximity and access to local services must also be considered relative to the 
units which are accessible”. 

Wexford County Council has to be cognisant of the current housing demand and the 
available supply of turnkey properties when assessing proposals. The Housing Department 
also works closely with AHB’s, many of whom specialise in the delivery of accommodation 
for people with disabilities. 

The motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Fleming, seconded by Cllr. M. Whelan and carried. 

13.5 Cllr. J. Hegarty 

"Wexford County Council has previously expressed its full support for the Healthy County 
Committees "Not around us" campaign  to discourage smoking or vaping in any outdoor 
area used by children and young people.In support of the next phase of  the "Not around  
us" campaign, I propose that any event organised by, funded by, supported by or on 
Wexford County Council property which engages children or young people would be 
designated a "Not around us” supporting event and would  display  the “Not around us” 
logo and signage in promotion of the event and at the event itself. his requirement will 
then be included in any event support or funding agreements, as standard. Soft copy 
graphics will be included on WCC website and  the  signage and banners available for 
events through  WCC MD offices. “ 

Response of the Executive: 

The Executive believes that this motion is a natural progression from the following motion 
which was passed in November 2021: 

“Wexford County Council commits to include all Council playgrounds, parks, beaches and 
areas designed for children and young people as part of the initial phase of the Healthy 
County Committee "Not around us" campaign. This will establish a series of places and 
spaces all over County Wexford where children and young people can enjoy themselves in 
a smoke and vape free environment”. 

Currently there are 32 playgrounds, 5 libraries and 8 beaches with Not Around Us signage, 
in addition to the Community sign ups. The Community Department will work with the 
Healthy County Committee and other relevant stakeholders to embed this practice within 
the organisation. 

This motion fell as the proposer wasn’t present to move the motion. 

13.6    Cllr. T. Forde and F. O Súilleabháin 

"This council welcomes the tax free Accommodation Recognition Payment (ARP) of €800

County Council Meeting 13.02.23 

Ukraine. We ask that such initiative be extended/implemented in an effort to 
accommodate all homeless people in Ireland. " 

Response of the Executive: 

If passed, this Motion will be forwarded to the Minister for Housing, for consideration. 

The motion was proposed by Cllr. F. O Súilleabháin, seconded by Cllr. J. Codd and carried. 

13.7    On behalf of all Councillors in the New Ross District  

"In light of the ongoing housing crisis, I call on the Minister for Housing to amend the Social 
Housing Allocation Regulations 2011 to  increase the suspension period from 12 to 24 
months for applicants who refuse an offer of a new property on   unreasonable grounds. 

Refusals on certified medical grounds or on the basis of a report from An Garda Síochana

times of a declared Crisis or Emergency is subject to robust committee oversight and 
approval of the Oireachtas. “
