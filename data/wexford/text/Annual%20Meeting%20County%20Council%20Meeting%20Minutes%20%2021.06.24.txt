Any Other Business 

Annual Meeting Wexford County Council 21.06.24 

Cllr. G. Carthy asked that presentations be taken prior to the start of the Plenary Meetings 
or at the end, as they are impacting on the ability to get through the agenda effectively. 
Cllr. B.A. Murphy suggested that Plenary Meetings should be held at 10.30am, as this may 
encourage greater female membership. There was a lengthy discussion on this matter with 
varying views expressed. Mr. E. Taaffe advised that this is a matter for the Members to 
decide and the Executive will work with whatever the majority decide. 

Cllr. M. Sheehan asked that the Protocol Committee meet as soon as is practicable to 
review standing orders, and in particular issues such as, time of meeting, speaking time, 
who can speak to a motion, direct negatives etc. 

THIS CONCLUDED THE BUSINESS OF THE MEETING.
