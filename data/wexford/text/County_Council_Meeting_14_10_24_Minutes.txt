Draft Taking In Charge - For Approval 

Ms. L. Hore outlined the purpose of the draft Taking in Charge policy and why it is needed. 
Cllr. B.A. Murphy raised concerns about legacy estates which have already applied to be 
taken in charge.  Ms. L. Hore advised that there are 117 taking in charge applications in the

some will be exceptionally expensive to remediate.  Cllr.’s T. Forde, G. Carthy, G. Lawlor, L. 
Kelly, L. McDonald, C. Byrne, M. Sheehan, and J. Codd all raised concerns in relation to the 
legacy applications.

six estates Uisce Éireann have committed to funding, and the timeline for the works.
