1.  Deputation from Management of Enniscorthy Greyhound Track 

At the outset The Cathaoirleach welcomed the Deputation comprising of Paddy Kavanagh (former 
Councillor), Myles Roban and John Cummins. He also welcomed Enniscorthy District 
Administrator Ger Mackey. 

The Cathaoirleach advised the members that the presentation was not to appear on social media 
during the meeting.  Paddy Kavanagh introduced the Deputation and advised that a public meeting 
regarding Enniscorthy Greyhound Track is due to be held in the Riverside Park Hotel on 
Wednesday 15th January, 2020 at 8pm and all members of the Council are invited to attend.  

He then gave a history of Enniscorthy Greyhound Track which was first formed in 1933 in the 
Showgrounds in Enniscorthy. Race meetings are held two nights a week, Mondays and 
Thursdays, and he noted that attendance has declined in recent years. He also noted that the loss 
of the greyhound track to Enniscorthy would be a big loss to the rural community.   

He then handed over to John Somers who advised that the decrease in funding has arisen as a 
result of the findings of the Indecon Report and the attendance figures used in that report in 
relation to the greyhound track in Enniscorthy were incorrect. The dog track is a huge benefit to the 
local community and is used by Charities, schools and other community groups for fundraising and 
also serves as a social setting for the public.  

Myles Roban gave further details from the Indecon Report. He advised that Enniscorthy 
Greyhound track is a privately funded organisation and he noted that four private tracks in Ireland 
are to be closed.

He again emphasised that the attendance figures were incorrectly stated in the Indecon Report – 
19,200 is the correct figure whereas 13,200 was the figure used in the Report. Funding is to be 
removed which will be the end of the greyhound track. 

He then advised that the Management Committee are getting submission documents ready at 
present to submit to Indecon and a public consultation will be held in the Riverside Park Hotel, 
Enniscorthy on Wednesday 15th January, 2020. 

He advised that the greyhound track brings in a figure of €2m from the local economy and that 
approx. €200,000 is raised by community groups, schools etc.  

He then presented the financial details of grant aid from Irish Greyhound Board and how a loss of 
that grant aid would affect the greyhound track.  Some of the funding received is for prize money 
and upkeep of greyhound track. He also noted that Enniscorthy greyhound track is not allocated 
any weekend nights for dog races.  

The Cathaoirleach then asked how Wexford County Council could help Enniscorthy Greyhound 
Track. 

Following a wide ranging discussion and support from Members of Wexford County Council the 
Cathaoirleach proposed that the Council would resolve to support the Enniscorthy Greyhound 
Track in their campaign and that WCC should allocate financial assistance towards the production 
of their submission with regard to the Indecon Report. 

Paddy Kavanagh on behalf of Management Committee thanked the Cathaoirleach and Members 
of Wexford County Council for their support and for giving the Management of Enniscorthy 
Greyhound Track the opportunity to make their case at a Special Meeting of the County Council.  

This concluded the business of the meeting.
