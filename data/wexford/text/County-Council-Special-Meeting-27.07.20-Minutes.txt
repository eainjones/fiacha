process  and  timelines  associated  with  the  review  of  the  County  Development  Plan.  Mr. 
Houston then made a PowerPoint presentation to the  meeting outlining the main elements 
of the new Plan as proposed. 

Mr. Houston stated that the pre-draft Plan contains objectives and policies  aimed 
reducing the impact of global warming here in Wexford, with emphasis on  renewable 
energies, nearly zero energy buildings, and reduction in carbon footprint. 

at 

The  new  Plan  must  incorporate  national  and  regional  planning  guidelines  and  will  also 
recognise the towns of Wexford and Gorey as key growth towns. 

Following Mr. Houston’s presentation, the Members thanked Mr. Houston and his staff for 
their   work in developing the pre-draft Plan, before raising a number of matters for further 
consideration and clarification: 

1.  Possible impact of proposals within the pre-draft Plan in relation to rural housing  

2.  Need for policies to actively support the provision of high speed broadband  

3.  Possibility of requiring all new houses to install energy-related improvements such 

as solar and PV panels 

4.  Objectives to facilitate the housing of returning emigrants in the area of their birth 

5.  Absence of national guidelines in relation to solar farms 

6.  Need for investment by Irish Water in rural towns and villages 

7.  Use of national density guidelines in rural towns and villages 

8.  Installation of innovative playground facilities in housing estate 

9.  Criteria to be applied in considering planning applications for renewal and reuse of 

older buildings 

10. Need  for  provision  of  additional  facilities  for  camper  vans  and  similar  vehicles  – 

particularly in coastal areas 

11. Use  of  reasonable  criteria  when  considering  the  preservation  of  buildings  and 

structures 

12. Proposed increases in sightlines for applications on local roads 

13. Energy  supply  implications  for  requiring  an  electrical  vehicle  charging  point  on  all 

new dwellings 

14. Criteria for assessment of applications for “granny flat” applications
