Pre Draft County Development Plan 2013-2019: 

Mr. E. Breen, County Manager, in launching the Draft County Development Plan 
2013-2019 outlined the County Council’s proposals for the future development of 
land including measures for the improvement of the natural and physical environment 
and the provision of infrastructure.  He confirmed that the review process and 
preparation of the plan would have had regard to key recent development trends and 
national, regional and local policy developments in particular the increased emphasis 
on flooding, climate change, renewable energy and the need to support economic 
development.  In his address he acknowledged that activity in the planning control 
area was down on recent years and he also referred to policy documents which 
controlled the population growth of towns, commented on flood risk assessment, 
wind energy strategy and changes in the retail strategy.  The Manager complimented 
staff on the preparation of the Pre Draft County Development Plan and advised that 
the only work being done by Consultants related to work on the appropriate 
assessment process. 

Mr. E. Hore, Director of Services, stated that the policies in the plan encouraged a 
positive approach to development and that new development opportunities would not 
be restricted unless there are strong persuasive justification for doing so having 
regard to European, national and regional policies.  The plan also recognised that 
prudent long term planning would help mitigate the unacceptable adverse impact of 
development and that the plan seeks to recognise the need to protect the 
environment with the demand for necessary developments to meet the needs and 
aspirations of the people of County Wexford.  The Director also referred to the 37 
guidance documents which had been issued by the Department of Environment 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special County Council Meeting 21.05.12 

which were reflected in the policies enshrined in the draft plan and he complimented 
the Planning Staff who had worked in the preparation of the draft plan.   

Ms. Deirdre Kearns, Senior Executive Planner, in a summary of the content of the 
written statement advised that the plan will provide for  

1.  A sustainable spatial development strategy to guide the location of the 

development. 

2.  Clear guidance on the future use of land and the pattern of development over 

the next 6 years. 

3.  A framework for the future investment in physical and social infrastructure. 
4.  A framework for developing the county’s economy. 
5.  Management and control by indicating standards to be achieved in new 

developments.  

6.  Ways to conserve and enhance the urban and rural environment and to 

protect the diversity of the natural and cultural landscape. 

7.  Guidance for public and private investors in relation to land use and 

development. 

The Senior Planner also confirmed that the draft plan had been prepared following 
extensive consultations where there were a series of public consultation evenings 
where members of the public and interested groups submitted their views and 
suggestions and also written submissions were received following the carrying out of 
a wide range of consultations with other stakeholders and service providers.  The 
Senior Planner also advised of the legislative context in which the draft plan was 
developed and prepared.  The introduction to the plan advised that the Local 
Authority had a duty to make a development plan for its functional area every 6 years 
and that the plan covered the entire county with the exception of Wexford Town, 
Enniscorthy Town and New Ross Town which are covered by their respective 
development plans.  The development plan is required to set out an overall strategy 
for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area and must consist of 
a written statement and a plan or plans indicating the development objectives for the 
plan area. 

The Senior Planning Staff then made a presentation to the Council on the following 
contents of the Draft Plan: 

1.  Demographic and Social and Economic Profile of County Wexford 
2.  Core Strategy 
3.  Housing 
4.  Climate Change  
5.  Employment Economy and Enterprise 
6.  Tourism

Larkin and Mr. E. Hore, Director of Services, Mr. D. Houston, Senior Planner, and 
Ms. D. Kearns, Senior Executive Planner.

A  report  on  the  winter  service  plan  prepared  by  Mr.  Jim  Power,  Senior  Engineer  was

of winter maintenance services throughout County Wexford.  The report advised that due to 
the length of the road network in County Wexford it would be not feasible to treat all roads in 
the  County  during  the  winter  season  and  accordingly  a  form  of  prioritisation  would  be 
necessary with routes divided into three priority designations. 

Questions  on  the  content  of  the  report  referring  to  routes  to  be  serviced,  interaction  with 
community  and  voluntary  groups  during  severe  weather,  the  availability  of  salt  and  grit 
county  wide  and  co-operation  with  neighbouring  counties  were  addressed  by  Mr.  Tony 
Larkin, Director of Services.

works in the winter service plan as circulated.

Budget 2013: 

The draft budget for 2013 was circulated to the Members.  The County Manager Mr. A. 
Doyle  advised  the  meeting  that  formalising  the  2013  draft  budget  had  again  been  a 
difficult task in these financially challenging times particularly in view of reduced central 
funding  over  the  past  2  years  and  also  a  reduced  income  from  the  Council’s  own 
resources.    He  continued  that  in  adjusting  the  2013  budget  it  was necessary  to  reflect 
the reduction in central government funding and the focus had been to protect in so far 
as  is  possible  the  core  principle  of  the  Council  to  maintain  and  develop  local  services 
and  infrastructure  which  are  central  to  the  economic  recovery  within  the  county.    He 
noted  that  an  important  issue  in  the  preparation  of  the  budget  was  a  reduction  in  the 
general  purposes  grant  allocation from  central  government  since  2008 from  €23.4m  to 
€18m, a reduction of approximately 23%.  Also as a consequence of the collection level 
of  the  Household  Charge  and  immediate  reduction  in  the  general  purposes  grant  was 
notified  in  2012  amounting  to  €0.481m.  He  also  advised  that  any  further  variation  or 
reduction  in  the  local  government  fund  grant  for  2013  would  require  a  post  budget 
adjustment  to  the  spending  programmes  of  the  Council  to  cater  for  any  variation.    He 
acknowledged  the  work  and  commitment  of  Staff  in  preparation  of  the  Draft  Budget 
2013. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statutory Budget Meeting 10.12.12 

Budget 2013 Overview: 

In  preparation  for  consideration  of  the  Draft  Budget  for  2013  Ms.  A.  O’Neill,  Head  of 
Finance,  made  a  presentation  to  the  meeting  on  the  factors  informing  the  Budget  for 
2013 and highlighted in particular the downturn in the economy, reduced central funding, 
reduced water charge accrual, final closure of refuse/landfill business, reorganisation of 
the  Community  Warden  Programme,  reduced  costs  activity  in  the  Fire  Service,  staff 
early retirement scheme and the full annual costs for 2012 new initiatives.  In addition to 
providing  an  analysis  of  these  matters  and  the  financial  impacts  Ms.  O’Neill  also 
highlighted  a  reduction  in  the  Local  Government  Fund  from  €23.4m  in  2008  to  a 
projected €17.2m in 2013 and also a reduction in Road Grant Funding from €19.2m in 
2008 to €12.8m in 2012.  The Head of Finance also highlighted significant expenditure 
and income movements that were reflected in the Draft Budget for 2013.  The Members 
were  also  advised  that  there  was  no  increase  in  charges  proposed  for  2013  for 
commercial  rates,  housing  rent  and water  service  charges  which  in  effect  was  the fifth 
year that the County Council did not apply any increase in these revenue areas.   The 
Head  of  Finance  also  outlined  to  the  meeting  details  of  the  Rates  Incentive  Scheme 
details  of  which  were  discussed  with  the  Members  and  received  enthusiastically.
