Oireachtas Members:  

Deputy Verona Murphy 

Public:  

A number of members of the public attended the meeting remotely 

Apologies: 

Cllrs T. Forde and Mr. T. Enright, CE 

The Cathaoirleach welcomed all to the meeting. 

1. 

Consideration of draft County Wexford Development Plan 2021-2027 and Chief Executive’s 
Report on submission received to the draft Plan 

Dep. Chief Executive T. Larkin addressed the Members and outlined the Members’ role in 
reviewing and adopting the Development Plan. 

Mr. Larkin advised that while he understood legislation was being considered to allow for an 
extension  of  the  period  within  which  a  Development  Plan  is  to  be  reviewed,  no  such 
legislation  was  yet  in  place.  Therefore  the  Members  were  working  within  the  current 
statutory framework which provided for a period of 12 weeks in which to complete their 
consideration  of  the  Draft  Plan  and  accompanying  report  of  the  CE  in  relation  to  the 
submissions received. 

Mr.  D.  Houston  SP  advised  that  it  would  be  helpful  at  this  time  to  begin  the  process  of 
consideration of the submissions received and the comments of the CE in relation to same 
as set out n the CE’s Report. 

Cllr.  Kelly  requested  that  the  review process  be  halted  in  view  of  proposed  legislation  to 
extend review period. 

Mr. T. Larkin advised the members that the review process to date has seen very high levels 
of  engagement  during  the  public  consultation  process.  H  also  stated  that  the  Council  is 
satisfied that it is compliant with the law in relation to its conduct of the review process and 
there is no reason to think that the review process and new Development Plan would be 
legally challenged. 

A  number  of  members  expressed  the  view  that  in  delaying  the  process,  the  Council  was 
stalling the public and creating an impasse, particularly in relation to local area plans, which 
can only be completed when the County Plan is complete. 

Mr. D. Houston clarified that the Members could consider some or all of the submissions 
made and the various Motions submitted thereon by the members, so long as the overall 
consideration by the Members was completed within the statutory 12-week process. 

It  was  noted  that  the  recommendation  from  the  Planning  Regulator  regarding  village 
boundaries was not currently being considered due to time constraints, and an extension of 
the review period might not support the continuation of this approach.

with the review process. This proposal was seconded by Cllr. G. Lawlor. The proposal was 
put to a roll-call vote and the following was the outcome of that vote.

Objectives in Volume 1: 
To support the development 
of updated national 
modelling of coastal erosion 
and in the absence of such 
adopt a precautionary 
approach to development in 
the coastal area.  

To amend Objectives 
CZM33, 34 and 35  on  page 
465-467 in Section 12.5 
Managing the Coastal Zone 
and Maritime Area General 
Objectives of Volume 1 as 
follows: 

Objective CZM33 
Within coastal settlements 
located on a soft shoreline 
or where a) is an identified 
area of coastal erosion risk, 
the Council will consider the 
development of buildings or 
uses (including caravans or 
temporary dwellings) where 
there are existing coastal 
protection works in place or 
these works are underway. 
In order for the development 
to be considered: 
 a) The development must 
not extend the length of the 
coastline that would require 
additional coastal protection 
works.  
b) The applicant must 
objectively establish based 
on the best scientific 
information available at the 
time of the planning 
application that the 
likelihood of erosion at the 
location is minimal taking 
into account, inter alia, the 
effectiveness of the existing 
coastal protection works and 
any potential impacts of the

Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

proposed development on 
erosion or deposition. 
  c) The onus will be on the 
applicant to provide the 
evidence (including 
appropriate modelling which 
incorporates climate 
change) to demonstrate that 
the development will not be 
at risk in the over its lifetime. 
The Planning Authority will 
have regard to recent and 
historic trends and events 
and the data sources 
referred to in CZM28 in 
assessing such applications. 
d) The applicant must also 
demonstrate that the 
proposed development will 
not pose a significant or 
potential threat to coastal 
habitats or features and is 
compliant with the Habitats 
Directive.    
 e) This  objective will not 
apply to minor extensions to 
existing buildings.  

Objective CZM34 
Within established coastal 
settlements located on a soft 
shoreline and where there is 
an identified coastal erosion 
risk and where there are no 
coastal protection works in 
place and no such work is 
underway or planned by the 
Council, the Council will only 
consider the development of 
infill sites where the 
development is a minimum 
of 100m (or greater such 
distance as may be 
specified by the planning 
authority having regard to 
the data sources referred to 
in CZM28) from the soft 
shoreline. In those 
circumstances the following 
applies:  

Page 5 of 52 

 
 
  
Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

a)The development must not 
extend the length of the 
coastline that may require 
coastal protection works in 
the future. 
 b) The applicant must 
objectively establish based 
on the best scientific 
information available at the 
time of the planning 
application that the 
likelihood of erosion at the 
location is minimal taking 
into account, inter alia, any 
potential impacts of the 
proposed development on 
erosion or deposition. 
c) The onus will be on the 
applicant to provide the 
evidence (including 
appropriate modelling which 
incorporates climate 
change) to demonstrate that 
the development will not be 
at risk in the over its lifetime. 
The Planning Authority will

d) The applicant must also 
demonstrate that the 
proposed development will 
not pose a significant or 
potential threat to coastal 
habitats or features and is 
compliant with the Habitats 
Directive.    

Objective CZM35 
Where the principle of a 
development outside of an 
existing settlement in the 
coastal zone is acceptable 
and it complies with the 
location objectives of the 
CDP, the Council will only 
give consideration to the 
development of a buildings 
and uses (including 

Page 6 of 52 

 
 
  
Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

caravans and temporary 
dwellings) where the 
development is a minimum 
of 250m  (or a greater 
distance as may be 
specified by the Planning 
Authority having regard to 
the data sources referred to 
in CZM28) from the soft 
shoreline or an area 
identified as at risk from 
coastal erosion. In order for 
the development to be 
considered: 
 a) The applicant must

into account, inter alia, the 
effectiveness of any existing 
coastal protection works and 
any impacts of the proposed 
development on erosion or 
deposition.

c) It must be demonstrated 
that the development will not 
pose a significant or 
potential threat to coastal 
habitats or features. 
d) The application will not 
permit a development where 
such development could not 
be adequately defended

To amend Section 4.9.6 
Modular Homes and Objective 
SH48 in Chapter 4 Sustainable 
Housing on page 142 as 
follows:   

Section 4.9.6 Modular Homes 
and Pre-fabricated Timber 
Homes 

Alternative forms of house 
construction are evolving, and 
in many cases, are resulting in 
more sustainable houses e.g. 
timber framed homes have a 
lower carbon footprint than 
concrete built homes. As these 
houses may be cheaper to 
develop, they also offer a more 
affordable housing option for 
many people. While the Council 
encourages the development of 
sustainable housing, there are 
concerns about the suitability of 
some building forms and 
associated external finishes, 
both in rural and urban settings. 

In all cases, where permission 
is sought for these homes in the 
open countryside, the 
developments will be assessed 
as one-off rural housing for 
occupation as a permanent 
residence, and accordingly the 
applicant will be required to 
demonstrate compliance with 
the local need criteria for the 
rural area type that the subject 
site is located within. A 
permanent residence condition 
will also be attached to the 
planning permission. The 
dwelling will be deemed to have 
fulfilled the applicant’s rural 
housing need, and going 
forward, the applicant will 
therefore be considered to have

previously owned a rural home. 
Notwithstanding, and in the 
case of a pre-fabricated timber 
dwelling only (e.g. log cabin 
type structure), the Council will 
consider the replacement of the 
structure with a house of more 
permanent construction by the 
same applicant on the same 
site subject to compliance with 
all normal planning and 
environmental criteria.  

As these developments are 
assessed as independent 
dwellings in the open 
countryside, it must have its 
own site edged red, comply with 
minimum site size 
requirements, be served by its 
own independent wastewater 
treatment system and water 
supply, provide a safe vehicular 
entrance that meets the 
minimum sightline requirements 
for the road on which the site is 
located, and comply with all 
other normal planning and 
environmental criteria and the 
relevant standards set out in 
Volume 2 Development 
Management Manual.  

Modular Units 
The use of modular units as 
permanent residences will be 
given consideration in rural and 
urban locations on a case-by-
case basis. It must be 
demonstrated that the units will 
be provide a high quality, 
sustainable construction with a 
lifetime similar to concrete 
construction (minimum 60 
years). The external finishes of 
the units must be in keeping

with the local vernacular 
finishes, and in this regard the 
units must therefore have an 
external plaster finish and 
normal roof slates. The units 
must comply with all other 
standards pertaining to 
residential developments. 

Pre-fabricated Timber Homes 
(Log Cabins) in Rural Nodes 
and the Open Countryside 

The Council will consider the 
development of pre-fabricated 
timber homes e.g. log cabin 
type structures on a case-by-
case basis on sites in the open 
countryside, and will have 
regard to the following as part of 
that assessment: 

•  The siting of the unit 
must complement its 
rural setting, be 
sensitively sited to 
ensure that it blends in 
with its surroundings and 
landscape setting, is not 
visually prominent 
especially when viewed 
from approach roads to 
the four main towns, 
scenic routes (see 
Section 5 in Volume 7 
Landscape Character 
Assessment) or detract 
from landscape character 
units which are assigned 
medium or high 
landscape sensitivity 
(see Section 5 in Volume 
3.2 Landscape Character 
Assessment). The unit 
should be simple in form 
and design and not have 
the characteristics of 
alpine dwellings. The

external materials will be 
considered on a case-by-
case having regard to the 
characteristics of the site, 
its visual sensitivity and 
visibility of the unit. The 
use of a timber external 
finish may be appropriate 
on some rural sites 
where the site is well-
screened and/or not 
visually prominent. 
Where a timber external 
finish is not considered 
appropriate, the Council 
will consider an 
alternative external finish 
e.g. render or an 
appropriate cladding. 

•  The site must be suitably 
landscaped, and details 
of the proposed 
landscaping must be 
submitted with the 
planning application. The 
planting should be 
specified by a suitably 
qualified person. Where 
a timber finish is 
proposed the tree 
planting must be at a 
density that will provide a 
woodland setting. The 
landscaping must be 
carried out before 
commencement of 
construction.  

•  The development must 
comply with all relevant 
Building Control 
Standards.

setting. The Council may give 
consideration where it will be on 
its own self-contained site with 
independent vehicular access 
and private open space. The 
structure must be simple in form 
and design, must not detract 
from visual amenity and must 
be in keeping with the existing 
built form and character of the 
area. In general, they will not be 
considered on the main 
thoroughfares in the town or

To amend the Chief Executive’s 
recommended ‘Table 4.5 
Indicative Density and Scale of 
Residential Development for 
Level 1-4 Settlements’ in 
Section 4.7.2.1 Density of 
Residential Developments 
(Chapter 4 Sustainable 
Housing, Volume 1) as follows:  

To ensure that 
the density of 
development in 
smaller towns 
and villages 
reflects the 
density of 
existing 
development 
where 
appropriate in 
the interests of 
proper planning 
and sustainable 
development of 
the 
settlements.   

Small Towns and Villages  

Centrally Located Sites 

Within a given smaller town or village, there can be marked variations in development 

context which affect the density of development and external space standards needed to 

take account of those contexts. Because of the variety of contexts and the probability of 

mixed use developments, it is difficult to be prescriptive about the level of density 

recommended. However, within centrally located small infill sites, densities of 30-40+ 

dwellings per hectare for mainly residential schemes may be appropriate or for 

more mixed use schemes.   

Page 40 of 52 

 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

Development of larger greenfield sites, which are not zoned under a local area plan or 

settlement plan, will be subject to overall densities of 20-35 hectare but will be required 

to provide a minimum of 40% for community or open space uses. Applications for 

residential developments of a maximum of 15 dwellings on a defined site will be required 

and further development will be considered once the first scheme has been satisfactorily 

completed. 

 Edge of Centre Sites 

The emphasis will be on achieving successful transition from central areas to areas at 

the edge of the smaller town or village concerned. Development of such sites tend to be 

predominantly residential in character and given the transitional nature of such sites, 

densities to a range of 20-35 dwellings per hectare will be appropriate including a wide 

variety of housing types from detached dwellings to terracedand apartment style 

accommodation. On un-zoned lands applications for residential developments of a 

maximum of 15 dwellings on a defined site will be required and further development will 

be considered once the first scheme has been satisfactorily completed. 

Edge of Small Town/Village 

In order to offer an effective alternative to the provision of single houses in surrounding 

unserviced rural areas, it is appropriate in controlled circumstances to consider 

proposals for developments with densities of less than 15 - 20 dwellings per hectare 

along or inside the edge of smaller towns and villages, as long as such lower density 

development does not represent more than about 20% of the total new planned housing 

stock of the small town or village in question. This is to ensure that planned new 

development in small towns and villages offer a range of housing types, avoiding the 

trend towards predominantly low density commuter-driven developments around many 

small towns and villages within the commuter belts of the principal cities and other 

similar locations. Such lower density development also needs to ensure the definition of 

a strong urban edge that defines a clear distinction between urban and the open 

countryside. On un-zoned lands applications for residential developments of a maximum 

of 15 dwellings on a defined site will be required and further development will be 

considered once the first scheme has been satisfactorily completed.

Planning Framework and the 
RSES for the Southern

The first Concept and 

Feasibility phase for the 

Oilgate to Rosslare Europort 

project was completed in 

2011. A Route Selection 

report completed at that time 

identified a Preferred Route 

Corridor. However, it has 

been determined that, given 

the lapse of time which has 

passed since 2011, the 

scheme would be reviewed 

from the start. After a 

comprehensive feasibility 

and constraints study, 8 

scheme options are currently 

being considered. 

The project is currently 
progressing through the 
option selection process 
which examines a range of 
multi-modal scheme options 
to determine the best option 
for the development of the 
project. A route corridor was 
previously selected for the 
scheme following the

the proposed scheme will 
proceed next, and it is 
anticipated that the project 
could proceed through the 
statutory planning processes 
by 2022. Separately, the 
‘N25 Ballygillane 
Roundabout’ scheme 
received Part 8 Planning 
approval in January 2020. 
That project will provide a 
roundabout on the N25 at its 
junction with the L7021 Link 
Road. The N25 Rosslare 
Europort Access Project will 
be developed to fully 
integrate with the N25

Europort. It includes the N25 

Ballygillane roundabout 

project which will provide a 

new roundabout at the 

existing junction between the 

N25 (St. Patrick’s Road) and 

the existing L7021 

(Ballygerry Link Road). This 

project received planning 

approval in January 2020, 

and Wexford County Council 

intends to proceed with the 

construction of the 

roundabout in 2021. Option A 

begins at this proposed 

roundabout with the 

Ballygerry Link Road, 

continues along the existing 

N25 National Road and 

terminates at the existing 

roundabout at Rosslare 

Europort. This ‘Do-Minimum’ 

option provides the baseline 

for the appraisal of all 

scheme options. 

Option B 

Option B (“Do-Something” 

Management Option) 

assumes that there will be 

investment to improve the 

existing N25 National Road 

corridor which will remain the 

access route to Rosslare 

Page 46 of 52 

 
 
  
Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

Europort. Option B seeks to 

utilise the existing asset 

where feasible through a 

package of on-line 

improvements which may 

include a mix of the following: 

the rationalisation of direct 

accesses onto the N25, 

provision of parallel service 

roads, left-in/left-out 

junctions, designated 

pedestrian crossing facilities, 

signalised junctions, and 

improvement works at 

Delaps Hill. This option will 

be developed to the “best 

possible standard” using the 

existing infrastructure. It also 

includes the N25 Ballygillane 

roundabout project which will 

provide a new roundabout at 

the existing junction between 

the N25 (St. Patrick’s Road) 

and the existing L7021 

(Ballygerry Link Road). 

Option B begins at this 

proposed roundabout with 

the Ballygerry Link Road, 

continues along the existing 

N25 National Road and 

terminates at the existing 

roundabout at Rosslare 

Europort. 

Option C 

Page 47 of 52 

 
 
Special County Council Meeting 14.06.21 

Option C (“Do-Something” 

Development Option) 

consists of a combination of 

existing road infrastructure 

along with a new road 

corridor to provide a new 

access route to the Rosslare 

Europort. This option utilises 

the existing Ballygerry Link 

Road and begins at its 

junction with the existing N25 

National Road, where the 

proposed N25 Ballygillane 

Roundabout is again 

included. A new section of 

road then extends from the 

existing junction of the 

Ballygerry Link 

Road/Churchtown Road and 

loops to the north, crossing 

the existing railway track 

before continuing east to 

connect into Rosslare 

Europort, via a new 

roundabout proposed as part 

of the future development of 

the Rosslare Europort. We 

are consulting with Rosslare 

Europort to ensure that any 

scheme proposal that may 

develop from this option will 

be compatible with the Port’s 

own future infrastructural 

plans.

Access Road 

The proposed access road to 

Rosslare Europort is also 

discussed in Section 8.7.1.1 

in Chapter 8 Transportation 

Strategy in Volume 1 Written 

Statement.  Following the 

completion of Phase 2 

(Option Selection), the 

Council confirmed the 

preferred selected scheme 

option for the route. The 

chosen option is combines 

the construction of a new 

offline access road to the 

port, and the upgrade of the 

existing Ballygerry Link Road 

as and is shown in blue in 

Figure RHK-4.  

The Preferred selected 
Scheme Option will now 
proceed to the next phase of 
the project, which is Design 
and Environmental 
Evaluation, during which it 
will be further developed to 
refine the design of the road 
alignment, junctions, 
accesses and structures. The 
environmental evaluation of 
the scheme will be 
progressed in tandem with 
design development, with 
both elements of the process 
influencing each other.
