Wexford Harbour and Slobs Special Protection Area: 

Mr. A. Doyle, Deputy County Manager advised that he had requested Mr. 
Lorcan Scott, National Parks and Wildlife Service to attend the meeting 
to explain the designation to the Members. 

Mr. Scott advised the meeting that the designation was proposed under 
EU legislation – EU Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) and would not change 
any of the operations currently present in the harbour, in particular any 
operation licensed by another Authority like Mussel Dredging, which was 
licensed by The Department of the Marine. 
Mr Scott further advised that the list of operations requiring consent of 
the Minister in the proposed area were to protect wild life and were 
generally operations, which would alter, damage, destroy or interfere with 
the integrity of the area. Those who had a legal interest in the area could 
only make objections to the proposal and the objections must be on 
scientific grounds. 

The Members of the Council expressed their concerns that as the 
proposed area stretched from Wexford Harbour to Enniscorthy it would 
effect any developments along that coastline in particular: 

•  The Trinity Wharf Development 
•  Mussel Dredging, which was listed as an operation requiring            

consent 

•  Leisure activities of Wexford Boat Club – also listed 
•  The Car Park at Ferrybank 
•  The provision of another River Crossing at Wexford  
•  Works to relieve flooding in Enniscorthy

Notice of Motions: 

Motion in the name of Cllr. John Dwyer: 

“That  this  Council  notes  the  increase  in  agency  employment 
throughout  the  economy.    We  are  aware  that  many  workers  from 
home  and  abroad  are  offered  agency  employment  when  they  are 
seeking direct and permanent employment. 

We  understand  trade  unions  have  raised  concerns  that  many  of 
these  workers  are  retained  on  minimum  conditions  and  in  some 
cases are not receiving all their entitlements. 

Agency  employment  should  not  be  used  as  an  unnecessary 
substitute for direct employment or as a mechanism for avoidance 
of or undermining of fair pay and conditions. 

Noting that legislation will come before the Oireachtas on the issue 
of Agency Employment, this Council believes and will recommend 
to  the  minister  that  the  principle  of  equal  treatment  should  be 
included in any such legislation on this issue”. 

The motion was seconded by Councillor T. Howlin and agreed by the 
Council. 

Motion in the name of Cllr. J. Curtis: 

“That  this  Council  calls  on  the  Minister  for  Education  to  grant 
University Status to Waterford Institute of Technology”. 

The motion was seconded by Cllr. T Howlin.

motion

County Council Meeting 11.02.08 

“ That this Council calls on the Minister for Education to grant

coming year”.

supports the view that the EU Lisbon Reform Treaty will enable the EU 
to speak with greater clarity and a louder voice on the international stage 
in  combating  climate  change,  international  terrorism  and  cross  border 
crime.

EU Lisbon Reform Treaty”

Water, Environment & Emergency Services: 

Nitrates Directive: 

Mr. N. McGuigan, Director of Service, advised the members that the Council 
was obliged to carry out farm inspections and report any irregularities to the

County Council Meeting 10.11.08 

Progress Reports: 

Housing: 

In response to member’s questions, Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Services, 
advised: 

•  There was a difficulty resolving the issue of separated persons who still 

had a legal interest in a house with regard to their social housing 
application.  Attempts were being made to deal with each application 
on its merits but there was a need for persons to resolve their legal 
issues.  He would brief the SPC on the matter. 

•  Applications were still being accepted under the Housing Aid for the 

Elderly Scheme but only exceptional cases were being approved as the 
budget was expended. 

•  There were issues still outstanding in relation to the Esmonde Road, 
Enniscorthy.  The Council had invested heavily in Chapel Lane, a 
playground, landscaping and planting, all of which had been subjected 
to vandalism.  The derelict house would be demolished shortly and 
plans were being prepared for the development of land in Council 
ownership in the area. 

Environment: 

In response to member’s questions, Mr. N. McGuigan, Director of Services, 
advised: 

•  The Consultants report on the suitability of the property for the Gorey

Sympathy:  

The Council extended sympathy to the following: 

•  Tony Murphy, General Foreman, on the death of his mother. 
•  Cllr. B. Dunphy, New Ross Town Council, on the death of his mother. 

Budget 2008: 

The  Draft  Budget  and  County  Manager’s  Report  for  2009  had  already  been 
circulated to the Council.   The County Manager outlined significant pressures impacting 
on the budget and main highlights for which provision was made as follows: 

The draft budget has been framed in the context of a very challenging economic period.  
The downturn in national exchequer returns has resulted in a reduction in the allocation 
from the Local Government Fund of 6.13% or €1.4m.  It has proven particularly difficult 
to present a balanced budget for the coming year.  While successful efforts were made 
over the last number of years to keep rates increases lower than the prevailing inflation 
rates, it is not possible to do so this year. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In summary the following are the proposals for some of the main charge-related income 
areas:- 

Statutory Budget Meeting 15.12.08 

•  The Rates increase proposed is 4.5%. 
• 

It is proposed to reduce Wheelie Bin charges  
240 litre bin - €399 
140 litre bin - €324 
80 litre bin - €224 
It is proposed to maintain the landfill charge at €110 per tonne (plus levy of €20) 
for one off customers. 
It is proposed to increase water and waste water charges by 3%. 

• 

• 

Following discussion the Council considered the detailed proposals of the budget. 

Division A – Housing and Building 

The members considered the provisions under services A 01 to A 11. 

In response to members, Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Service, advised: 

Increased income from rents was due to increased housing stock. 

• 
•  The allocation for D.P.G.’s and housing aid for the elderly will not meet the 

current demand and a report outlining proposals will be brought to the members 
early in the new year. 

•  Support staff for RAS had been pared down but were sufficient to meet the 

workload. 

•  The Council’s traveller accommodation units were satisfactory and any reduction 

in the allocation would result in a deterioration of the service.  

Division B – Road Transport and Safety 

The members considered the provisions under services B01 to B11. 

In response to members questions Mr. A. Doyle, Director of Services, advised 

•  The  provisions  for  grant  income  were  estimated  as  the  allocations  from  the 

Department were not yet notified. 

•  There  was  a  provision  of  €100,000  for  taking  housing  estates  in  charge  with  an 

income of €50,000 from local contributions. 

•  Tender prices for works were sought annually.                    
•  Maintenance  works  on  local  bridges  would  be  carried  out  from  the  general 

maintenance provision. 

•  Emergency repairs would be carried out from the general maintenance provision. 
•  Provision  and  improvement  of  public  lighting  would  be  funded  from  a  capital 

balance.  There is a sufficient amount available to do this for one year. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statutory Budget Meeting 15.12.08 

Division C – Water Services: 

The members considered the provisions under services C 01 to C 07.  

In response to members questions Mr. N.McGuigan, Director of Services, advised 

•  Water  Services  for  the  Town  Councils  were  now  being  administered  by  the 
County  Council  hence  the  contributions  from  other  Local  Authorities  were 
omitted.  

•  The  bulk  of  Public  Convenience  maintenance  provision  was  the  Council’s  own 

maintenance costs.                              

Division D – Development Management: 

The members considered the provisions under services D 01 to D 12.  

In response to members questions Mr. E. Hore, Director of Services, advised 

•  There  was  €13,225,000  levied  under  the  development  levy  scheme  with 
€6,677,000  collected.    The  Planning  Enforcement  Section  followed  up  on  the 
collection  but  not  all  of  the  balance  was  due  as  some  developments  had  not 
commenced while others were being built in stages. 

Division E – Environmental Services: 

The members considered provisions under services E 01 to E 14. 

In response to members questions, Mr. N. McGuigan, Director of Services, advised 

•  House insurance  normally covered Fire Services costs for attendance and there 

was a hardship scheme in place. 

•  The Council had 17,000 domestic refuse customers. 
•  A  commercial  refuse  collection  would  be  considered  but  the  Council  would 

remain with the domestic only for the present. 

•  The Council was negotiating with commercial customers on landfill charges.  

Division F – Recreation and Amenity: 

The members considered the provisions under services F 01 to F 06. 

In response to members questions Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Services, advised 

•  Reduction  in  expenditure  under  the  Arts  programme  would  not  jeopardise  the 

overall programme 

•  The  provision  under  Community  Grants  included  long  term  funding  of  capital 

projects 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Statutory Budget Meeting 15.12.08 

Division G – Agriculture, Education, Health and Welfare: 

The members considered the  provisions under services G 01 to G 06.  There  were no 
issues arising.  

Division H – Miscellaneous Services: 

The members considered the provisions under services H 01 to H11.   

In  response  to  members  questions,  Mr.  G.  Mulvey,  Head  of  Finance,  advised  that  1% 
increase in the rates yielded €157,990. 

Adoption of Budget 2009: 

Cllr.  D.  MacPartlin  proposed  the  members  adopt  the  following  public  statement  in 
relation to the 2009 budget 

“The  imposition  of  the  increase  in  the  rates  on  business  premises  is  directly  related  to 
€1.4 million reduction in the local authority fund provided by the Government. 

Because  of  this  cut,  the  decision  by  Councillors  to  increase  rates  is  inevitable  in  the 
absence  of  any  other  source  of  income.    We  acknowledge  that  this  is  an  unfair 
imposition  on  the  business  sector  at  a  time  when  many  of  them  are  encountering 
economic difficulty. 

However Councillors are required by law to agree a budget and failure to do so will lead 
to their dissolution with the budgetary decisions then taken by the County Manager. 

We do not believe that a dissolution of the County Council is in the best interest of the 
people of Co. Wexford as the ability of members to act for citizens in the difficult times 
ahead  is  of  paramount  importance.    Accordingly,  and  with  the  greatest  of  reservations 
we have had to agree the budget proposed for 2009”. 

This was seconded by Cllr. P. Reck and agreed by the Council. 

It  was  proposed  by  Cllr.  P.  Reck  and  seconded  by  Cllr.  L.  Allen  that  Wexford  County 
Council  adopt  for  the  financial  year  ending  31st  December  the  draft  budget  with  the 
following amendments  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reduce Rates Increase to 3.5% 
Reduce Water Charges Increase to 0%   
Increase Income for Landfill 
F0401 Reduce Community Grants

H0906 Reduce Members Conferences abroad
