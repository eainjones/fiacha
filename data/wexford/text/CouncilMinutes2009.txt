County Manager’s Report: 

The  Members  considered  the  County  Manager’s  Report  as  circulated.    In 
response to the Members, the County Manager advised: 

•  The  allocation  of  €2m  over  four  years  from  the  Department  of  Marine  and 
Natural Resources for Wexford Harbour presents an opportunity to carry out 
works that would otherwise not be done.  The Manager further advised that 
the Council should resolve to take over the Wexford Harbour in line with the 
request from the Department.  On the proposal of Cllr. M. Byrne, seconded 
by Cllr. P. Codd, the Council resolved to take over Wexford Harbour.

mostly  been  absorbed  by  the  reduction  in  the  Local  Government  Fund 
Grant. 

•  The CPO for the New Ross By Pass had been challenged in the High Court 
and  a  date  for  a  hearing  is  awaited.    On  the  assumption  that  the  statutory 
process  is  successful,  the  NRA  has  commenced  the  procurement  process 
for a PPP Project.

Budget 2009: 

The  County  Manager  advised  the  meeting  that  the  2010  Budget  provided  for 
revenue expenditure of €109m and together with the Capital Programme there would be 
expenditure by the Council of almost €200m in 2010. 

The Manager further advised that there was concern about the Council’s deficit and the 
possibility that the 2010 road grants would be less than 2009.  Even with the Road Grant 
maintained  at  2009  level  the  Council  would  struggle  to  maintain  employment  for  the 
roads  staff.    The  Department  of  Environment  had  notified  the  Council  that  there  would 
be  a  small  increase  in  the  Local  Government  Fund  and  that  the  Council  could  retain 
some  of  the  payroll  savings  announced  in  the  National  Budget  which  would  help 
address  the  matter  of  the  Council’s  deficit.    Being  conscious  of  the  financial  pressures 
being  experienced  by  both  commercial  and  household  sectors  the  draft  Budget  was 
presented  with  no  increases  in  Commercial  Rates,  Commercial  Water  Charges, 
Domestic Refuse Charges or Housing Rents. 

The Manager recommended the Budget to the Council. 

The Council considered the detailed proposals of the Budget.

stimulating our economy here in County Wexford.   If it is possible for Members 
of  the  executive  with  the  public  representatives  to  look  at  areas  that  I  believe 
have great potential for growth.  Such as:  Tourism, alternative energy, energy 
conservation,  off  farm  enterprises  and  supporting  the  manufacturing  industry 
here in County Wexford. 

We should also  encourage  people to shop local and  look  at the  whole  area  of 
shopping incentives. 

Wexford  County  Council  is  the  only  Body  to  provide  the  leadership  that  is  so 
badly needed in today’s difficult climate”

Motion in the name of Councillor M. Byrne 

“Pending  the  resolution  of  the  issue  of  the  applicability  or  not  of  commercial 
rates to childcare facilities by Government, that Wexford County Council would 
suspend pursuance of such facilities for payment of commercial rates.” 

This motion was seconded by Councillor M. Sheehan. 

Following  discussion  by  the  Members  the  County  Manager  advised  that  he 
could not suspend the collection of rates from ay one sector of rate payers, the 
rates were liable and he was statutorily obliged to collect them. 

Motion in the name of Councillor M. Byrne 

“That in the awarding of contracts by Wexford County Council, regard shall be 
had to the record of applicant companies in the payment of sub-contractors.” 

This motion was seconded by Councillor M. Sheehan. 

Following  discussion  by  the  members  the  County  Manager  advised  that 
domestic sub-contractors were a matter for the main contractor and the Council 
had no relationship with them.   Nominated sub-contractors are protected under 
the  terms  of  the  contract.    Therefore  it  would  be  impossible  for  the  Council  to 
ascertain  the  status  of  the  payment  record  between  the  main  contractor  and 
domestic sub-contractors. 

Councillor  M.  Byrne  amended  this  motion  to  read  “nominated  sub-contractors” 
and the motion was agreed by the Council. 

This concluded the business of the meeting.

In response to the Members the County Manager advised; 

•  Overtime costs were €3m in 2008 which represented 8% of payroll costs 
and  were  the  industry  norm.    However  measures  had  been  taken  to 
reduce  overtime  costs  which  included  tighter  management  and  a  pre 
determined response system to emergency call outs which may result in 
some responses at weekends not being delivered.  
Indoor  staff  numbers  had  been  reduced  by  nearly  100  in  the  past  18 
months. 

• 

Mr. A. Doyle, Director of Corporate Affairs and Roads, advised: 

•  The  maintenance  of  full  time  employment  of  the  staff  was  of  major 

concern. 

•  Agreements had been reached through the Handling Significant Change 
Committee  for  the  redeployment  of  drivers  due  to  the  shortfall  in  the 
Department’s grant for road maintenance. 

•  There were 3 types of overtime 

-  Planned i.e. street sweeping at weekends. 
-  Fixed i.e. certain procedures – opening and closing of offices out 

of hours. 

-  Emergency Call Outs – our traditional response was to respond to 
every  call  out,  the  emphasis  being  on  the  quality  of  the  service 
rather  than  the  cost.    These  practices  had been  examined  and a 
system of all call outs being channelled through the emergency no 
1890 666 777 was now installed where call outs could be logged 
and assessed against a pre determined response system to see if 
a call out was warranted out of normal hours.  All on-call staff had 
been met and the new system agreed.

•  The  DOEHLG  had  requested  some  clarification  regarding  the  Gorey

specify to the landowner the works needed to remediate the problem. 
In  relation  to  the  by-pass  projects  the  NRA  approve  the  schemes  and 
fund  them  and  the  Council  acts  as  an  agent  for  the  carrying  out  of  the 
work.

The  Members  requested  the  Council  write  to  the  5  TD’s  requesting  them  to 
made  representations  to  have  the  revised  loans  assessment  guidelines 
rescinded due to the difficulties being experienced by applicants obtaining loan 
approval.

“That Wexford County Council calls upon the National Roads 
Authority  to  amend  it’s  plans  on  the  proposed  N11  Clogh  to  Enniscorthy 
scheme, to include a bridge at Rockspring, Ferns and that this locally important 
road not be closed”. 

This motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Kinsella, seconded by Cllr. M. Byrne. 

The  County  Manager  advised  that  the  Council  should  allow  the  oral  hearing 
process deal with the matters raised as that was the proper forum.  It would be 
inappropriate  for  the  Council  as  a  Statutory  Roads  Authority  to  pass  such  a 
resolution. 

Following discussion by the Members Cllr. Kinsella withdrew his motion. 

Councillor  M.  Byrne  and  Cllr.  P.  Reck’s  motions  were  deferred  to  the  October
