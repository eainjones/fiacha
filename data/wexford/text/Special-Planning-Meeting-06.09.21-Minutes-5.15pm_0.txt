The Cathaoirleach declared the outcome of the vote as 15 FOR, 10 AGAINST, 1 ABSTAIN and the 
counter motion was deemed carried.

To facilitate a choice of housing types within areas, limited provision may be made

neighbourhood or district as a whole average, densities achieve the densities mentioned 
above.* 

This Motion was amended at an earlier meeting that afternoon and the above subsequent 
amendment was sought to clarify that the density applies to Level 1 and 2 settlements

3.4 

To amend the Energy Strategy as follows: 

1.  

Amend  text  on  page  5-6  in  Section  1.5  Strategic  Environmental  Assessment  and 
Appropriate Assessment as follows: 

The Energy Strategy has been subject to Strategic Environmental Assessment 
(SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) as part of the Pre-Draft Wexford County 
Development Plan 2021-2027. The full SEA and AA are contained in Volumes 12 
and 13 of the Pre-Draft Wexford County Development Plan 2021-2027. 

Delete the first two paragraphs in Section 5.4 How the SEA Informed the Wind 
Energy Strategy on page 61. 

2.  

Amend  Chief  Executives  recommendations  CE  V10.6  and  CE  V10.8  in  the  Chief 
Executive’s Report Book 5 as follows: 

CE V10.6  

CE V10.8  

Amend last column of Table 5 to reflect 70% RES-E rather than 53.8%, 
page 24. The final Plan will include the breakdown of the figures for 
each of the renewable energy types. 

Amend last column of Table 6 to reflect 70% RES-E rather than 53.8%, 
page 25. The final Plan will include the breakdown of the figures for 
each of the renewable energy types. 

3. 

Amend text on page 106-107 in Section 7.1 Marine Renewables as follows: 

The Framework Directive for Maritime Spatial Planning (Directive 2014/89/EU) 
was transposed into Irish Law through Part 5 of the Planning and Development 
(Amendment) Act 2018 and requires that a Maritime Spatial Plan for Ireland must 
be in place by 2021.  

This plan, known as the National Marine Planning Framework (NMPF) in Ireland, 
is a 20-year plan for the country’s maritime areas. It provides the over-arching 
framework for marine decision-making that is consistent, evidenced based and 
secures a sustainable future for our country’s marine area. It contains a series of 
overarching policies over environmental, social and economic themes, and 
provides sectoral policies for 16 sectors ranging from renewable energy, 
aquaculture, port, harbours and shipping to tourism and defence.  

The NMPF is a parallel document to the National Planning Framework, which 
guides terrestrial planning and development. 

The Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 also seeks to establish a coherent and 
comprehensive marine planning system to manage development and activities in 
Ireland’s seas. It will establish in law a new planning regime for the maritime 
area. It will replace existing State and development consent regimes and 
streamline arrangements on the basis of a single consent principle, i.e. one State

consent (Maritime Area Consent) to enable occupation of the Maritime Area and 
one development consent (planning permission), with a single environmental 
assessment. This legislation is designed to work for all types of development – 
from the smallest structures to the largest offshore windfarm proposal and will be 
critical to ensuring Ireland meets its ambitious offshore renewable targets.1

planning-framework-and-publish-maritime-area-planning-bill/ 

4.  

Amend  all  references  in  the  Energy  Strategy  to  reflect  the  recommended 
amendments to the Settlement Hierarchy in the Chief Executive’s Report Book 1 and 
amend  Maps  5,6  and  14  accordingly.  This  will  include  providing  appropriate 
exclusion zones around these settlements where appropriate in the changing the 
‘open for consideration’ areas for both wind and solar energy development. 

5.  

Amend Map 6 to exclude Designated Sites and Distinctive Landscapes from the Area 
Open for Consideration for Solar Farms.  

Proposed by Cllr. BA Murphy, seconded by Cllr. P. Breen and agreed. 

2.6 

To amend the Chief Executive’s Recommendation, CE OPR 19, on page 91-92 of the Chief 
Executive’s Report relating to the definition of Category A Housing for Persons with a 
Demonstrable Social Functional Rural Housing need to live in Structurally Weak Rural 
Areas as follows:   

A person building a dwelling house as their permanent place of residence and who has not 
previously owned a rural house. (See Point 4 in Definitions and Notes regarding owning a 
rural house). The person can work from home or commute to work daily. 

This Motion was amended at an earlier meeting in the afternoon and the above 
subsequent amendment was sought to remove the seven year requirement which was 
inconsistent with the earlier amendment which removed the local rural area from 
structurally weak areas. The Motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Fleming and seconded by Cllr. 
P. Breen and agreed. 

3.2  We  propose  that  draft  county  development  plan  be  amended  to  provide  for  general 
densities in the range of 20 to 50 per hectare, and under 20 to be discouraged and that the 
executive  draft  the  appropriate  amendments  to  the  core  strategy  to  give  effect  to  this 
amendment.  

The  Motion  had  been  deferred  from  the  meeting  earlier  that  afternoon.  Following 
discussion, it was agreed to amend the Motion as follows:

Provision for Lower Densities in limited cases: 

To  facilitate  a  choice  of  housing  types  within  areas,  limited provision may  be  made 

for lower density  schemes of  a  minimum  of  20 units  per hectare,  provided that within  a 

neighbourhood or district as a whole, average densities achieve the densities mentioned 

above. 

The amended Motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Farrell, Cllr. P. Barden, Cllr. Jackser Owens, 
Cllr. Leonard Kelly, Cllr. John O’Rourke, Cllr. David Hynes, Cllr. Anthony Connick and agreed 
by all. 

2.15 

To  amend  the  Chief  Executive’s  Recommendation  reference  CE  OPR  19  relating  to  the 
definition  of  Category  B  Housing  for  Persons  with  a  Demonstrable  Economic  functional 
need in the Strong Urban Influence Rural Area, the Stronger Rural Area and the Structurally 
Weak  Rural  Area  Types  on  pages 91  – 93  of  the  Chief  Executive’s  Report  by  adding  the 
following text to the definition: 

Functional economic need will also be related to persons who are working in that particular 
local rural area in a non-rural resource-based activity where such employment is full-time 
and  permanent.  The  applicant  must  be  able  to  provide  documentary  evidence  that  the 
employment is full-time and permanent.  

The Motion had been deferred from the meeting earlier that afternoon. The Motion was 
withdrawn by Cllr. M. Whelan. 

The following Motion was then proposed by Cllr. M. Sheehan: 

That this Council adopts the recommendation of the Chief Executive as set out in the 
Chief Executive’s Report on the Draft Development Plan, as amended and modified by the 
Elected Members at its meetings held to discuss that draft development plan and 
accompanying Chief Executive’s Report. 

The Motion was seconded by Cllr. J. Hegarty and agreed by all. 

Tony Larkin advised that the planning authority must consider under Section 12(7)(aa) 
whether a Strategic Environmental Assessment or Appropriate Assessment or both such 
assessments of the Material Amendments is required. He advised that having considered 
the Material Amendments contained in the Chief Executive’s Report and those passed to 
date he recommended that the Council make a determination that these assessments are 
required. 

He advised that the Chief Executive will make a determination on how long this will take 
(under Section (12)(7)(ab)).
