It was agreed at the outset to take item No. 2  Proposed Variation No. 2 to the Enniscorthy 
Town and Environs Development Plan 2008 – 2014 as extended. 

The Deputy Chief Executive advised that documents regarding the variation had been 
circulated to the Members and the proposed variation relates to the acquisition of 16 hectares 
of land located to the South of the Plan area directly north of St. Senan’s Hospital.   The 
purpose of the proposed variation is to change the land use zoning to allow for a Business 
Park which would facilitate office, light industry, manufacturing and incubator type units.    This 
project is a key element of the Council’s economic strategy. 

On the proposal of Councillor M. Sheehan, seconded by Councillor J. O’Rourke, the proposed 
variation was agreed by the Council.  

Item  No. 1  –  Chief Executive’s  Report on  the  Pre-draft  Consultations  on the  Review  of 
the Wexford County Development Plan, 2013 – 2019 and the Preparation of a New Plan 
for the County:

of the document circulated.   The Chief Executive had considered the submissions and issues 
raised by following the public consultation and had made recommendations for policies arising 
from those submissions.   

The Cathaoirleach thanks the Planning Department for the huge amount of work that had gone 
in developing the report which was put before the Council.   He also thanked the Councillors 
for their input into this stage of the process. 

This concluded the business of the meeting.
