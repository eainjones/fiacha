and in particular 
villages that have 
lost post 
offices/shops in 
recent years. 
4/ in the interest of 
development of key

Enniscorthy Town: 
 “Enniscorthy as a 
Smart Town 
a.)  Enniscorthy is 
designated a smart 
town by the Southern 
Regional Spatial and 
Economic Strategy 
(RSES). Wexford 
County Council will 
develop a detailed 
development strategy 
based on this 
designation with a 
particular focus on 
developing 
Enniscorthy as a 
national leader in 
digital technology, 
innovation and 
transformation with a 
view to making 
Enniscorthy well 
connected, 
sustainable, resilient 
and technologically 
literate.  
b.)   The council will 
leverage information 
and communication 
technologies, the 
internet of things, 
geospatial technology 
(such as geographic 
information systems,

technology and 
geofencing), artificial 
intelligence, 
blockchain 
applications, cloud 
based applications and 
wireless technologies, 
among others, to 
develop and future 
proof Enniscorthy. The 
council will prioritise 
Enniscorthy as an early 
adopter of smart 
technology. Wexford 
County Council will 
leverage technological 
solutions for 
Enniscorthy to 
improve public 
services, 
infrastructure, social, 
economic, tourist, 
employment and living 
experiences of 
Enniscorthy’s 
residents.      
c.)    In developing 
Enniscorthy as a smart 
town, Wexford County 
Council will seek, 
private, public, and 
governmental 
(International, 
European (including 
Interreg funding), 
national and local) 
investment. It will 
furthermore seek to 
develop strategic 
research and 
innovation 
partnerships with 
suitable European 
partner towns and 
cities.

County Council Meeting 14.09.20 

Enniscorthy as a smart 
town strategy and 
acknowledging 
Enniscorthy town’s 
strategic importance 
as a UN centre of 
excellence in energy 
efficiency in High 
Performance 
Buildings, Wexford 
County Council will 
specifically pursue a 
focused Smart Town | 
Smart Environment 
strategy which marries 
the smart town 
strategy with 
environmental 
sustainability aims. 
The council will look to 
Reykjavik and 
Amsterdam, among 
others, for precedent 
and inspiration.  
e.)   Wexford County 
Council will develop 
Bunclody and Ferns as 
smart hubs under the 
umbrella of the 
Enniscorthy Smart 
Town strategy.” 

On page 51 and after 
point 13, inserts the 
following:  
“14.)    With the 
opening of the 
Enniscorthy bypass, 
Enniscorthy is at risk 
of suffering the same 
economic and social 
impact of commuting 
that towns of a similar 
distance from Dublin 
have suffered. The

opportunities in 
Enniscorthy is a 
priority for the council 
in order to reduce and 
prevent the 
development of 
unsustainable levels of 
commuting and to 
tackle existing levels 
of social deprivation. 
To this end the council 
will focus on 
increasing 
employment and 
economic 
development in the 
town. While the 
council will facilitate 
all types of economic 
development there 
will be a strong focus 
on life sciences, funds 
and other similar 
financial services 
sectors and 
environmental 
research and 
development 
sectors.    
15.)     The council 
recognises 
Enniscorthy’s role as a 
historical market town 
with a large natural 
catchment area. In 
particular, the council 
recognises the close 
historical and 
economic connections 
of the Level 3 service 
Settlements of 
Bunclody and Ferns 
with Enniscorthy 
town. The council will 
strengthen the 
economic, tourism 
and transport

connectedness 
between these urban 
centres, including the 
development of 
strategic cycle routes 
and improvements to 
walking infrastructure 
and rural transport 
links.  
16.)    The council 
acknowledges the 
environmental, 
tourism and economic 
importance of the 
River Slaney and will 
seek to develop these. 
The council will also 
focus on developing a 
Blueway between 
Bunclody and 
Enniscorthy to include 
adjacent cycleway and 
walking trail. The 
council will make a 
significant effort to 
abate and reverse the 
degradation of the 
river Slaney at 
Clohamon bridge and 
its environs.  
17.)     The council 
recognises the need 
for increased water 
capacity for 
Enniscorthy town and 
will prioritise working 
with Irish Water to 
deliver this necessary 
increased capacity.   
18.)     The Council 
recognised the 
importance and 
potential to County

DIARMUID HOUSTON need 
to take a flexible 
approach - agreed 

A  number  of  issues  were  raised  during  the  discussion  on  the  above  proposals  and 
amendments to the plan including: 

1.  Cllr  Donohue  raised  an  issue  regarding  the  lack  of  waste  water  infrastructure  in 
villages mentioned in p36,37,38 Mr. Tony Larkin advised that this needs to be taken 
up with Irish Water as they are now the water provider. 

2.  Cllr L McDonald noted that Wexford should not be seen as an adjunct of Waterford.  
3.  Ms.  Deirdre  Kearns  confirmed  that  the  Core  strategy  and  Housing  strategy  are 

aligned. 

4.  Mr.  Diarmuid  Houston  advised  that  defining  Zones  for  density  levels  in  the  town 

would be best done under the LAP’s. 

5.  The  Chief  Executive  advised  the  members  that  there  decision  on  this  draft  plan 
would be  hugely important over the next  years for development in the county  and 
needed to considered carefully so they do not have an adverse impact. 

6.  Cllrs  McDonald  and  Barden  asked  where  there  would  be  suitable  housing  to 

facilitate any further decentralization of government departments. 

7.  Cllr  Owens  raised  a  question  on  the  status  of  the  Enniscorthy  Flood  Defence 

Scheme. 

On  the  proposal  of  Cllr  G  Lawlor  and  seconded  by  Cllr  M  Sheehan  the  draft  plan  was 
adopted with the proposals / amendment agreed above. 

This concluded the Business of the Meeting.
