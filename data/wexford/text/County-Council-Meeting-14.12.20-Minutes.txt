confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Legislation be redirected from central

“I ask that Wexford County Council write to the Minister for Housing, Local  
Government and Heritage, Darragh O Brien, and ask that the local authorities  
allocation for disability adaption works be increased to match the need of our  
demand. In the very least we ask that funding be reinstated to the previous level  
before it was reduced by 16% on 2019 levels to €481,053. 

This council is mindful that reductions to these funds has and is preventing many

motion is circulated to all Local Authorities.

County Council Meeting 14.12.20 

"This Council notes the centenary of the passing by the British Parliament at  
Westminster of the Government of Ireland Act in December 1920, the Act which  
provided for the Partition of Ireland. We recall the deep injustices, divisions and  
conflict caused by this Act. We reiterate our support for the Good Friday Agreement 
and the political process arising from it, including the revoking of the Government 
of Ireland Act. We reaffirm our support for the self-determination of the people of 
Ireland as expressed in Article 3.1 of Bunreacht na hÉireann and for the bringing  
about of a United Ireland "by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the 
people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions".  

Accordingly we call on both the Irish and British governments to fully implement  
the Good Friday Agreement and all their obligations with regard to the rights of  
citizens; we call on the British government to agree to set a date for the Irish Unity 
referendum as provided in the Agreement; we call on the Irish government to work 
for this outcome.  

We stand ready as a Council to work with all statutory bodies and with civic society 
to plan and prepare for the referendum on Irish Unity and for a positive outcome to 
the referendum." 

Proposed by Cllr. F. Ó Súilleabháin and seconded by Cllr. J. Codd.

referendum as provided in the Agreement when circumstances permit. We call on 
the Irish government to work for this outcome.

 Cllr. L. Kelly 

 “In the Program for Government a commitment to an allocation of 10% of the total 
transport capital budget for cycling projects and an allocation of 10% of the total  
capital budget for pedestrian infrastructure was made. The commitment to cycling 
and pedestrian projects is set at 20% of the 2020 capital budget (€360 million) per 
year for the lifetime of the Government. 

In order to place Co. Wexford front and centre of securing our share of this funding, 
I propose that Wexford county council prioritise the development and adoption of a

high-quality cycling policy and that the department of Transport are approached by 
the Council to have Wexford, New Ross, Enniscorthy and Gorey included under the 
remit of the NTA from where the expertise of the newly created cycle design office 
can be sought. 

As part of this I propose that Wexford County Council carries out a full assessment 
of our roads network and develops cycle network plans paying particular attention 
to the development and renewal of walking and cycling strategies for urban settings 
(for travel to education, work and for recreation), which will be implemented with 
the help of a suitably qualified Cycling Officer with clear powers and role.” 

Proposed by Cllr. Kelly, seconded by Cllr. L. McDonald and agreed.  

In agreeing the Motion, the Members asked that rural villages and towns in County 
Wexford would also be considered for similar investment. 

13.6   Cllr. M. Sheehan & Cllr. P. Breen 

 “That this Council backs the Government support for the Greyhound and Horse  
Industry and calls on the Minister to ensure continued support and funding on a  
multi-annual basis. 

Proposed by Cllr. Sheehan, seconded by Cllr. P. Breen and agreed
