1.  Filling of Casual Vacancy following the election of Malcolm Byrne to Dáil Éireann.  

At the outset The Cathaoirleach welcomed Andrew Bolger and his family to the meeting and he 
also welcomed Malcolm Byrne, TD. He then wished the best of luck to all members of the 
Council who are standing in the forthcoming General Election.  

Cllr. J. Sullivan proposed Andrew Bolger to be co-opted to fill casual vacancy arising from the 
resignation of Malcolm Byrne and this was seconded by Cllr. P. Breen and agreed by all.  

Cllr. J. Sullivan advised the Council that Andrew Bolger was a young man of 22 years of age 
who had worked diligently on behalf of the Fianna Fail Party for the past number of years. He 
had served his time as a member of the party and earned his chance to be co-opted to 
Wexford County Council.  

The leaders of all the political parties, a number of independents and members of the Fianna 
Fail party then welcomed Andrew Bolger to the Council, congratulated him on his co-option to 
the Council and wished him well on his future work with the Council. 

The Chief Executive then congratulated and welcomed Andrew Bolger on behalf of the 
Management and staff of Wexford County Council. He noted that it was a great honour to 
become a member of the Council at such a young age. He offered him any help and assistance 
that he might require in his role as a Councillor. 

The Chief Executive also welcomed Deputy Byrne back to the Council Chamber and joined 
with the Cathaoirleach in wishing the best of luck to the Council members standing as 
candidates in the forthcoming election.

Cllr. A. Bolger then thanked the Members of the Council and the Chief Executive for their kind 
words and he stated that he looked forward to working with them over the coming years. He 
noted that he may require advice from the members and the Management Team and he would 
be happy to seek such advice.  He is eager to carry out his role as a Councillor to the best of 
his ability and is willing to learn all that is required to make him an effective Councillor. 

The Cathaoirleach then thanked Cllr. M. Farrell for standing in for him at the recent awards 
ceremony in Dublin and congratulated the Environment and Community Departments for their 
hard work in achieving success at the awards.  

This concluded the business of the meeting.
