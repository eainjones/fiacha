The Cathaoirleach welcomed all to the Special Meeting, which was convened to review the severe 
flooding event of Christmas Day, 25th December 2021. The Cathaoirleach summarised the nature 
of the incident and the response of the Council staff to same. 

The Cathaoirleach outlined her desire to see the Council put in place a Swift Water Response 
Team, trained and resourced to respond to such incidents in the future. 

The CE Mr. T. Enright summarised the incident and briefly outlined the scale of the severe weather 
event and the actions of the Council staff in responding to the challenges that emerged during 
Christmas Day and the days immediately after. While extensive damage had been caused across 
the County, then main areas to experience significant flooding were Enniscorthy, parts of Gorey, 
Bridgetown, and surrounding areas. A number of bridges were severely damaged with extensive 
damage to road surfaces in many areas. 

Mr. Enright congratulated and thanked all who responded to the emergency event, including the 
Elected Members, Roads Staff, Fire Personnel, Water Services Staff, Civil Defence, An Garda 
Siochana, RNLI and Coastguard, OPW, Dept of Social Protection, members of the Executive and the 
local communities. 

Mr. Enright also thanked Minister Patrick O’Donovan for travelling to Wexford to view first-hand 
the affected areas, and for his promise to support the Council’s request for the necessary funding 
to remediate the significant damage caused. 

Ms. Carolyne Hore, DoS, outlined the details of the emergency response by the Council to the 
event, describing the response as timely, professional, significant and on-going. 

Mr. E. Hore, DoS gave a detailed presentation on the scale of the damage caused by the flooding, 
the remediation costs of which were currently estimated at €3.6million but may well rise to 
approximately €5 million following ongoing inspections. Mr. Hore advised that the process of 
determining the nature and extent of the damage was continuing. 

Mr. D. Minogue A/DoS provided the members with an update in relation to the Enniscorthy Flood 
Relief Scheme. 

All members contributed to the ensuing discussion and joined in congratulating and thanking the 
staff for the manner in which they had responded and taken a leadership role in managing the 
event.  

Members pointed to the role of the OPW in river management and asked that the Council engage 
with the OPW in relation to future drainage and maintenance in the affected areas.

The Council reconvened following a brief comfort break. 

Members asked that the Humanitarian Aid Scheme be applied as flexibly as possible to allow 
owners of flooded properties to be compensated to the greatest extent possible. 

The Members also asked that the Wexford Oireachtas Members support the Council in its request 
to Government for the necessary financial assistance to allow the extensive damage to be 
remediated as quickly as possible. 

It was agreed that emergency road diversions currently in place would be reviewed to ensure that 
disruption to road users will be minimised. 

The Members expressed thanks to the representatives of the Department of Social Protection for 
their prompt response to the flooding emergency. 

It was agreed that the Council’s Flood Emergency Plan be reviewed to include Wellingtonbridge, 
Duncormick and Bridgetown areas. 

The role of Rescue 117 Helicopter in responding to the flooding incident was noted and the 
Council requested that the service be maintained and adequately resourced into the future. 

It was agreed to consider an information campaign in the Spring to encourage landowners to 
properly maintain drainage networks on their lands. 

It being past 5.30pm, and on the proposal of Cllr. Lawlor, seconded by Cllr. L. McDonald, the 
Council agreed to amend Standing Orders to allow the meeting to continue for a further 30 
minutes. 

Council agreed to call on the Wexford Oireachtas Members to support the Council’s request to the 
Minister for Public Expenditure to expedite the Enniscorthy Flood Scheme. 

The meeting concluded with the Cathaoirleach and Chief Executive thanking all involved for the 
manner in which they had responded to the flood emergency event
