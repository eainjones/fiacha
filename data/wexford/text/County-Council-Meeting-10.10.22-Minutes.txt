County Council Meeting 10.10.22 

“This council calls on the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to address 
the issue that has arising in many instances since the ‘Vision for Change’ 2006 was enacted, 
where people suffering from addiction are not admitted into psychiatric care and this has 
led to tragedy on a number of occasions .”

"We ask that Wexford County Council implement a 60 day homeless prevention plan for all 
those at risk of losing their homes or tenancies and also ask that Minister Darragh O'Brien 
provide any necessary resources to assist with the implementation of such a plan." 

Response of the Executive: 

The South East Regional Strategic Management Group has adopted a Regional Homeless 
Prevention & Support Project (RHPSP) which is being operated in all 5 LA’s in the region.  
The RHPSP prioritises homeless preventions by way of applying early interventions, 
mediation and prevention measures to those seeking homeless services/emergency 
accommodation. To ensure consistency in how the service is being provided across the 
region, the following steps are used by all staff that carry out homeless assessments and 
provide homeless supports. 

Conduct a homeless assessment and identify client’s immediate needs – “At Risk” following 
issue of NTQ - Provide support/advice to client re: validity of the notice and ensuring 
current social housing application information is up to date.  Clients that are “At risk” of 
homelessness do not have an immediate need for alternative accommodation and all 
relevant supports are offered to them i.e. early intervention, mediation with other relevant 
third parties e.g. family, landlords other agencies. 

Clients who present who are not social housing applicants receive immediate support with 
completing a social housing application.  These applications are processed by the 
HSSU/Placefinder and are prioritised over all other social housing applications. 

Clients will always be encouraged to try and source alternative private rented 
accommodation and are issued with up to date HAP forms.  This does not mean that the 
HSSU are not also working to find a solution to meet the applicant’s needs.  The HSSU, 
utilise social housing allocations, Housing First tenancies,  licenced properties and main 
stream HAP tenancies to provide social housing supports.
