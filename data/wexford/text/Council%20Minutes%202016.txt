“This Council calls on the new Government to reverse the decision to introduce Pay - by -

the new Minister of Social Protection to address this anomaly as those who need to avail of 
the grant are not in a position to find the deposit in advance.  A simple solution could be an 
application form allowing payment to go directly to the landlord or letting agency”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. D. Wadding, seconded by Cllr. M. Byrne. 

Cllr. K. Doyle left the meeting during this item declaring potential conflict of interest.

10.4 Cllr. D. Wadding: 
“We immediately call on the new Minister to protect the livelihoods and well being of our 
firefighters by exempting their retainer fees from income consideration by DSP. Some 
firefighters who put their lives on the line for the community are surviving on less than 
minimum wage having had to leave jobs that would not allow them the flexibility to be on 
call. They are then penalised by DSP because of the retainer. We urge the new 
government to end this penury for our frontline workers”.

well paid and resourced individuals cannot benefit from legal aid.” 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne.  Cllr. J. Mythen proposed an amendment to

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. D. Hynes and was agreed by the Council. 

It was noted that this motion had previously been passed by the Council. 

8.E. Councillor Johnny Mythen: 
“That  this Council  recognises  the  strong  public  opposition to  green  bin  charges  and opposes 
the  introduction  of  a  pay-by-weight  system  imposed  by  the  previous  Labour  Minister  for  the 
Environment, Alan Kelly which is due to come into effect from July 2016; 

recognises the serious financial difficulties this system will cause for the 70,000 carers across 
the state who cannot recycle medical waste material, and; low-income earners; those in receipt 
of state benefits, and those who suffer from ill health or disability; 

recognises  that  the  introduction  of  green  bin  charges  will  discourage  people  from  recycling 
their household waste; 

Calls on the Government to take into account the concerns expressed by citizens, carers and 
advocate organizations and stop the imminent imposition of this scheme.” 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Mythen seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding.

County Council Meeting 13.06.16 

8.F. Councillor Johnny Mythen: 
“That  this  Council  would  support  the  open  letter  by  the  Master  of  the  High  Court  to  acting 
Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly and its immediate call to action re the housing crisis.   
That we, as a Local Authority identified in this letter, recognise the immediate urgent need for 
social housing now.   Also given the time scale of at least 2 to 3 years for new builds, it would 
be  both  incumbent  and  legally  appropriate  to  acquire  houses  from  vulture  funds  through 
compulsory purchase orders.” 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Mythen seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding. 

The motion was carried. 

The Chief Executive notified the members that all of the Chief Executives had met with the new 
Minister for Housing and the Taoiseach in Dublin recently.  The Minister said that Housing is 
the main priority of the new government and had sought suggestions from the Chief Executives 
as to how the provision of new housing could be expedited.   

The Chief Executive also highlighted the initiative taken earlier in the year by Wexford County 
Council  with  regard  to  seeking  expressions  of  interest  from  property  owners  who  wished 
develop their properties. 

8.G.  Councillor George Lawlor: 

“In view of the fact that the “Programme for a Partnership Government” contains the following 
paragraph: 

Technological Universities: 

The new Government will support the creation of Technological Universities. These regional 
institutions will have greater links to industry and will have an enormous impact on our capacity 
to create and retain jobs in regions. We will prioritise those institutions with clear ambitions and 
plans for the furthering of industry-relevant technological research and education. The 
requirement of a mandatory merger of existing institutions can be reviewed, if a case can be 
proven, that for geographical reasons, a merger isn’t feasible. 

“Wexford County Council calls on the new government to immediately commit to a University 
of the South East with the merging of Carlow IT and Waterford IT as any move to allow a “go it 
alone” approach by Waterford IT will have a disastrous affect on Co. Wexford.” 

Cllr.  M.  Byrne  notified  the  Cathaoirleach  that  the  issue  under  debate  could  give  rise  to  a 
perceived conflict of interest and he left the meeting while the matter was debated. 

Cllr.  G.  Lawlor  asked  that  the  last  paragraph  of  his  motion  be  amended,  to  read  as  follows: 
“Wexford County Council calls on the new government to immediately commit to a University 
of the South East with the merging of Carlow IT and Waterford IT”). This was accepted by the 
Members.  The  amended  motion  was  seconded  by  Cllr.  M.  Sheehan  and  agreed  by  the 
meeting.

8.H. Councillor Barbara Anne Murphy: 
“In view of recent activities in south east Carlow I call on Wexford County Council to establish a 
compressive policy to regulate mining within our county, so as to protect the environment, the 
landscape, local economies, livelihoods and communities” 

The  above  motion  was  proposed  by  Cllr.  B.A.  Murphy,  seconded  by  Cllr.  D.  Wadding  and 
agreed by all.

write to the Minister again. 

Cllr. M. Farrell stated that she was not satisfied with the correspondence from the General

In addition, he was delighted with the initiative of the Junior Council as it was an important way 
to show young people the way democracy worked.  He outlined the low level of third level 
education in County Wexford and hoped that St. Senan’s could be used as a centre of 
excellence for training in skills and trades.  He also wished to continue the work of the

his interest in education of young people. He also commended the outgoing Leas-
Chathaoirleach, Cllr. Kathleen Codd-Nolan, in particular the accomplished manner in which 
she led the Council delegation to Savannah. 

The Chief Executive welcomed Cllr. Anthony Kelly back after his recent illness.   

He offered his own congratulations to the newly-elected Cathaoirleach, Cllr. Paddy Kavanagh 
and Leas-Chathaoirleach, Cllr. Michael Whelan, and looked forward to working with both in the 
year ahead.  He emphasised the good working relationship that exists between the Members

  Financial Position of the Council at 30th June, 2016 
  LPT Analysis including buoyancy, variations & averages 
  Rates Analysis including ARV & customers 
  Budget Strategy 2017 Conclusions & Recommendations  

She further advised that a Preliminary Estimate of Income and Expenditure for the coming 
financial year was submitted to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community & Local 
Government by 23rd September 2016.  A decision in relation to the LPT Variation for 2017 
must be notified to the DHPCLG and the Revenue Commissioners by 30th September. 

The  Cathaoirleach  introduced  the  Chief  Executive,  Mr.  Tom  Enright  who  gave  a  brief 
presentation on the economic benefits of raising Council funds through a proposed increase 
of  5%  in  LPT  and  the  economic  vision  for  County  Wexford  through  the  development  of 
property solutions.    

The  Cathaoirleach  complimented  both  the  Head  of  Finance  and  the  Chief  Executive  on 
their presentations.  There followed a lengthy discussion during which the Chief Executive 
and the Head of Finance responded to a range of issues raised by the Members including: 

Increased Staff Costs & the central funding for the provisions of Lansdowne Road 

Impact if 0% increase in LPT 
Impact of amalgamation of Pension Levy 

  LPT Equalisation Fund 
 
  Vacant properties within the town centres 
  Charity Shops status 
 
 
  Rates Harmonisation 
  Social Housing 
  Rates Incentive Scheme (RIS) 
  Urban Renewal 
  Job Creation & Economic Development 

Of  the  topics  raised  the  rates  exemption  of  charity  shops  was  mentioned  as  a  particular 
issue especially when they are in direct competition with rate paying businesses.  The Head 
of Finance confirmed that the Council’s local policy of rates exemption is only applied if the 
shops have been granted charitable status by the Revenue Commissioners  and this policy 
can be revised by the Councillors if they so  wish.  It  was agreed that this topic  should be 
reviewed  and  considered  further  with  a  view  to  amending  the  local  policy  for  the  2018 
financial year. 

Another  issue  of  note  was  the  increase  in  staff  costs  associated  with  the  reversal  of  the 
Lansdowne Road agreement under the FEMPI programme.  The current position is that the 
local  authority  will  need  to  fund  this  cost  from  the  Council’s  own  resources.    Cllr.  Byrne 
pointed  out  that  all  other  public  sector  bodies  would  receive  central  funding  for  these 
increased  costs.    He  further  stated  that  to  his  knowledge  the  only  sector  not  receiving 
central  funding  for  this  cost  was  Local  Government  and  he  proposed  that  the  Council

As discussion on the remaining agenda item was no longer in-committee, members of the 
Press attended the meeting. 

Local Property Tax Variation: 

Following  a  discussion  on  the  topic  of  variation  of  the  Local  Property  Tax  the  following

8.  Review of land acquisition in Anne Street, Wexford for new Government Offices: 

County Council Meeting 10.10.16 

The attached Review, prepared by Director of Services, Tony Larkin was circulated to the 
members of the Council. The Director outlined the context and circumstances which led to the 
Review being commissioned. 

He detailed the meetings he had with Members of the Council and other interested parties 
where he heard their concerns regarding the land acquisition in Anne Street. He also referred 
to the files he examined in respect of the case, including the Council’s own files and legal files 
relating to the case. 

The Director highlighted the complexity of the case. He advised the meeting about the process 
used by the Council to allow access to both Councillors and other interested parties to the files 
and to copies of documents, in accordance with Data Protection principles. 

Having examined and considered all of the above, the Director set out his findings under three 
separate headings, as follows: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

There was no evidence that Wexford Borough Council acted “ultra vires” i.e. outside it’s 
powers in respect of the acquisition of the two sites in question.  

There was no evidence of any party receiving money to which they were not entitled. 

There was no evidence of any party being unfairly treated or adversely affected by the 
actions of Wexford Borough Council. 

Finally, the Director summarised that he had heard the concerns of Councillors and interested 
parties, examined the files and tried to deal with the issues raised. He pointed out that no 
further prima fascia evidence had been produced during the process period and that it was not 
possible for the Council to deal with third party issues in which they were not involved. 

Following the Director’s presentation, Cllr. W. Fitzharris stated that, given the complexity of the 
issues, he needed time to study the report. Cllr. D. Wadding asked that the publication of the 
report be delayed to take account of new information which had come to light. 

On the proposal of Cllr. M. Byrne seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding, it was agreed to invite 
comment from members, to be submitted in writing to the Director, before Friday 28th October 
2016. The Director agreed to examine any such new evidence and amend his report take 
account of the evidence submitted, if appropriate. 

Cllr. J. Moore left the meeting at 5pm 
Cllr. J. O‘ Rourke left the meeting at 5pm 

9.  Adoption of Part IV of the Public Health Act 1890, (as amended) for Wexford Town,

Tuesday 15th November, 2016, and all Members were encouraged to attend. 

6.  Review of land acquisition in Anne Street, Wexford for new Government Offices: 

Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Services, advised the meeting that arising from the decision at the 
meeting of the Council to seek any further submissions in relation to Anne St., he had received 
only one submission which was circulated to the Council Members. 

The Director noted that the issues raised in the submission had already been dealt with and 
required no amendments to the original report presented to the previous meeting of the 
Council. 

Cllr. W. Fitzharris withdrew his motion in respect of Anne Street, given that the matter was up 
for discussion under this item.  He proposed that a further meeting should be held with the 
people involved and some Members of the Council; Cllr. D. Wadding supported the motion. 

The Cathaoirleach advised the meeting that they were not covered by privilege and advised 
Members to take care with any statements they intended to make as part of the debate. 
A debate then ensued to which a number of Members contributed dealing with issues of how 
this matter could now be dealt with. 

Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Services, outlined once again the work that had gone into the 
preparation of the review including the meetings with the group involved and some members of 
the Council.  He had heard their concerns and had taken the approach that if something was 
uncovered he would report it.  He noted that while the file was complex, the Council displayed 
its duty to deal with the issues raised in a transparent manner.  He noted that the ongoing and 
lengthy public discussion of this matter was causing reputational damage to the Council. He 
concluded by stating that all the questions raised had been answered. 

The Chief Executive, Mr. T. Enright, stated that it was important to be aware that the Council 
Chamber is neither the Dáil nor a Commission of Enquiry. The Council cannot deal with 
innuendo and hearsay, but must deal with facts. 

Mr. Enright also queried why it had taken so long for these matters to come forward and why 
these issues were not raised at the time. 

The issue as to whether the Council acted ultra vires or did something wrong had been dealt 
with by the Director. His findings were that there was nothing done that was wrong; the 
transactions were part of the normal business of Wexford County Council.

County Council Meeting 14.11.16 

The Chief Executive stated that the Council had investigated the issues raised and that no new 
issues had arisen since the October 2016 meeting.  It is now time to draw a line under the 
review.  He advised that parties can contact the Council’s Solicitors with any new evidence.  
Continuing to deal with innuendo and hearsay brings the Council into disrepute and this cannot 
be allowed to happen. 

The Cathaoirleach then closed the debate and advised Members to bring up any issues with 
the Director or the Chief Executive.  

7.  European Capital of Culture: 

Mr. J. Carley, Director of Services, presented a report in respect of the European Capital of 
Culture bid, which was circulated to the meeting 

The Cathaoirleach Councillor Paddy Kavanagh welcomed the new Arts Officer Liz Burns to the 
meeting and assured her of the help and assistance of all the Members of the Council. He also 
highlighted the hard work done by volunteers in preparation of Wexford’s submission for the 
European Capital of Culture. 

A discussion about the Capital of Culture ensued in which the Members echoed the remarks of 
the Cathaoirleach about public participation in the process on a voluntary basis and the great 
energy created during the process.  The regional approach outlined in the Director’s Report 
was also supported by Members and the proposed collaboration between the three Counties 
will be worked on in the future. 

Ms. L. Burns, Arts Officer, thanked the Members for their support and noted that she was 
available to meet Members to address some of the matters raised in detail. 

The Chief Executive welcomed the Arts Officer and advised Members that the Council would 
be seeking an increase in the 2017 budget for the Arts.  He also thanked the volunteers for 
their efforts and time and he highlighted the value of working together with the other partners in 
the region as an important part of the Council’s Arts Strategy for the region in the next few 
years.

overseas, to consider the evidence and decisions other armed forces have taken to stop 
the administration of Lariam (Melfloquine) to their serving forces overseas because of the 
long-term damaging side effects Lariam was having on their troops and to consider 
advising the Irish Medical corps to do the same. 

Taking into account the American Armed forces have stopped using Lariam since 2009 due 
to the psychotic and long term effects this drug was having  on its troops, particularly in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, taking into account the French armed forces have also removed

rules and restore the pensions for people who have, in good faith, contributed all their lives

losses”.

would comprise 13% of this state's population[2]; 

This Council requests the relevant Ministers, Departments, and appropriate agencies: 
- to update us on what steps are being taken by this state and government to secure a 
ready supply of BCG Vaccine - regardless of regime adopted for administration - and when 
this will be available again.

South Dublin to be expanded to three lanes and for Transport Infrastructure Ireland to 
develop a comprehensive plan, involving public and private transport, to improve 
commuting travel times between the Counties of Wexford and Wicklow and Dublin. This 
motion will also be forwarded to the Councils of Wicklow, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and 
South Dublin”. 

This motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne, seconded by Cllr. R. Ireton. 

A vote was taken and it was agreed by all with the exception of Cllr. D. Wadding.   

Cllr. M. Byrne: 

“That Wexford County Council welcomes refugees from the Syrian conflict to this County 
and will assist positively in integrating them to Irish society. On their expected arrival in 
2017, the Council will arrange an appropriate welcoming reception. 

This Council asserts that Wexford is a welcoming County for those who seek refuge or 
asylum from war, natural disaster or the abuse of human rights”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne, seconded by Cllr. D. Wadding and 
agreed by all present. 

The Chief Executive advised that he had been sitting on the Task Force for Refugees since 
2014 and was aware of the tragic circumstances regarding refugees and the need for 
Ireland and County Wexford to play its part in helping them. 

He noted that Syrian Refugees would arrive in Ireland by the middle of 2017 and that the 
Refugee Commissioner would deal quickly with their applications for refugee status, 
allowing them to settle in Ireland within a short number of weeks. 

Housing will be a critical service to be offered to the refugees and Wexford County Council 
is already looking at housing solutions which will not impinge on our current housing list.  
The housing units required in County Wexford would mostly be family units.  The Chief 
Executive advised that he would report back to the Council on this issue in the New Year.
