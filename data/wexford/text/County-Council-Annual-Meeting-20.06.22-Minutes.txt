proud and privileged to have had the opportunity to represent her county at these events, 
such as Savannah Trade Delegation, London Wexford Association Dinner Dance, and a vast 
number of local events.

Ukrainian Displaced Persons crisis and the manner in which the Council is leading the 
Wexford Community Forum in its support of the response.

and spoke of her outstanding performance during her term of office in representing 
Wexford County Council and County Wexford with pride, professionalism and
