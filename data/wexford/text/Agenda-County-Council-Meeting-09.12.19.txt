12. Notices of Motion 

12.1 Cllr. Lisa McDonald 

“That this Council prepare a report as to best measures that can be taken to reduce the 
numbers of stray dogs in the County pound  which has one of the highest number of stray 
dogs and dogs being euthanised in the Country  . In the interim, and as a measure to stop the 
high level of dogs being euthanised,   this Council directs that the pound in Ballycarney  to 
 post photographs on its social media sites ( to be set up  and promoted if necessary ) to 
increase the prospects of rehoming”. 

12.2 Cllr. John Hegarty 

“In light of ongoing efforts to both offer leadership opportunities to younger people as well 
as encouraging participation in the democratic process and the workings of Wexford County 
Council, I propose that Wexford Junior Council (that was run so successfully in recent years) 
be reconvened with immediate effect. Furthermore, it should have a clearly defined work 
programme for the year to include a chance to debate and give feedback on current council 
projects, an opportunity to speak on occasions where the event is primarily targeted at young 
people and a symbolic chain of office for the chairperson”.
