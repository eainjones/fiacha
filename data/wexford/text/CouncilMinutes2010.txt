number of years and would continue to do so.

Iarnród Eireann were experiencing economic difficulties due to decreased

•  Significant staff efficiencies had been achieved over the past number of 

years. 

•  The ongoing viability of the Rosslare/Waterford Rail Service was seriously

bus service.

•  The South East Regional Authority was commissioning a business plan to 
support the retention of the Rail Service and it was desirable that Iarnród 
Eireann considered that Plan.  

•  There were two large freight users opening up in the area and the 

possibility of their custom should be examined. 

•  The population decrease in the south Wexford area was due to the lack of 
services but with the infrastructure about to be provided under the Water 
Services Investment Programme the population would now increase in 
those areas. 

Mr. McHugh advised that they were unaware of the possibility of new freight 
business in Wexford but would investigate.  Iarnród Eireann had made a

decision.

Presentation by Jacobs Engineering Ireland Consultants on the N30 
Moneytucker to New Ross Scheme: 

Mr.  D.  Curtin,  National  Roads  Authority  Liaison  Officer,  Mr.  R.  Butler,  Roads 
Design  Office,  Tramore,  Mr.  John  Fleming,  Director,  Jacobs  and  Mr.  Gregg 
Houghton, Senior Engineer, Jacobs, attended the meeting. 

In a presentation to the meeting Mr. John Fleming outlined details of the proposed 
road improvements of the N30 from Moneytucker to New Ross.    He advised the 
meeting that the works would commence in the Townland of Rathgarogue at the 
western  end  of  the  New  Ross  By-pass,  would  by-pass  the  village  of  Clonroche 
and  finish  in  the  Townland  of  Moneytucker  at  a  tie-in  to  the  constructed 
Moneytucker to Jamestown Scheme. 

The  proposed  road  development  would  by-pass  Clonroche  and  would  make  the 
village  safer,  quieter,  cleaner  and  a  more  attractive  place  in  which  to  live,  work 
and visit.   Safety would be improved on the route and improved journey reliability 
time  by  a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  at  grade  unsignalised  priority 
junctions and a reduction in the number of direct, private and field accesses to the 
new road. 

The  scheme  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed  Enniscorthy  and  New  Ross  By-
passes would completely upgrade the N30 from New Ross to Enniscorthy to the 
appropriate National Primary Roads standards. 

In  response  to  the  presentation  a  number  of  members  raised  queries  as  to  why 
the  route  should  change  from  the  originally  agreed  line  to  whom  Mr.  Fleming

County Council Meeting 12.07.10 

responded  the  main  reason  for  the  change  was  safety  concerns  and  related 
matters.    The members also raised the issue of the need for greater consultation 
and  were  advised  by  Mr.  D.  Curtin,  National  Roads  Liaison  Officer,  that  there 
would be ample time for comprehensive consultation with the affected parties as 
(the Part 8 planning process) was about to commence, with the proposal unlikely 
to start until well into next year. 

In  response  to  the  concerns  expressed  and  other  matters  raised  the  County 
Manager referred to the likely completion dates for the New Ross and Enniscorthy 
By-passes  which  would  link  into  this  proposed  roadway  and  he  confirmed  that 
arrangements  would  be  made  for  a  workshop  in  Clonroche  to  further  advise 
interested  and  concerned  parties  on  proposals  for  the  N30  Moneytucker  to  New 
Ross Road Improvement Scheme. 

The meeting was advised that plans and particulars of the proposed development 
will be available at the County Hall, the Enniscorthy District Office and Clonroche 
Community  Hall  from  Wednesday,  14th  July  to  Wednesday,  25th  August,  2010, 
with  submissions  and  observations  with  respect  to  the  proposed  development 
receivable up to Wednesday, 8th September, 2010. 

Following  discussion  the  members  decided  by  majority  vote,  to  commence  the 
Part 8 Planning process under the Planning and Development Regulations, 2001 
to 2009 in respect of N30 Moneytucker to New Ross Road Improvement Scheme.

County Council.

Donegal.

the scale of the problem in the County shall be outlined along with strategies to 
address outstanding problems." 

Following discussion of the motion at which Members voiced concerns at families 
having to live in unfinished estates and the potential costs of completion to 
standards satisfactory to the Local Authority and having noted some inaccuracies 
in the recent published Department of Environment report on ghost estates it was 
agreed to identify the problem estates in each electoral area and to submit a 
report on the matter to each Electoral Area Committee for further consideration.  

Cllr. P. Codd: 

“We are all aware of Rosslare Europort contribution to the economic wellbeing of 
our area.  I was surprised and disappointed to learn that during 2010 the escalator 
wasn’t  working,  lights  were  switched  off  to  save  money  and  reduce  carbon 
emissions, buffet bar was also closed.  This in my opinion is unsatisfactory; I am 
asking Wexford County Council to put pressure on Iarnród Eireann to improve this 
situation ensuring it never happens again”.

County Council Meeting 13.12.10 

Notice Of Motion: 

Councillors P. Cody, T. Howlin, G. Lawlor, R. Ireton: 

“Wexford Co. Council  calls on the Government to recognise the  unique and vital 
role  of  the  Postal  Service  in  Ireland,  particularly  rural  Ireland,  as  a  means  of 
communication, as a vital economic tool and as an intrinsic part of the community. 

Our  Postal  Service  has  a  social  value  and  an  economic  value,  these  must  be 
properly protected as the Government drafts legislation to open the postal market 
to full competition. Postmen and  women provide  an important public service and 
also function as an integral part of the social fabric of their community, particularly 
for the elderly and the isolated citizens whose only human contact might be their 
post  person. Furthermore An Post's extensive delivery  and collection network, is 
an  intrinsic  part  of  the  economic  and  business  infrastructure  of  the  country. 
Reaching  every  corner  of  the  country  and  by  delivering  to  every  front  door  An 
Post is an essential partner in business from a marketing, payment collection and  
business generation point of view. 
As  Ireland  prepares  to  liberalise  its  postal  market  it  is  essential  that  the 
Government  acknowledges  this  important  public  service,  ensures  that  the 
Universal  Service  Obligation  is  protected  by  legislation  and  does  not  allow  the 
opening  of the market to  lead to  wide spread job losses, social dumping and  an 
erosion in service levels as had happened in other countries who have already  
opened their postal market to competition”. 

Councillors: Malcolm Byrne, John Hegarty, Robert Ireton,  

Michael Kinsella, Declan MacPartlin: 

“The recent bad weather has further emphasised both the economic and social 
value of the existing postal service.  In the firm belief that the future needs of 
business and of the community as a whole will be best served by the maintenance 
of the service as currently operated we emphatically support the campaign of the 
postal workers to continue the existing national policy.  In Article 9 of the Lisbon 
Treaty there is clear EU concern for the preservation of employment and for the 
social dimension to be central to any EU policy.  This concern also exists in 
Recital 16 of the European Postal Directive which states that ‘Social 
considerations should be taken into due account when preparing the opening up 
of the postal market’. 
Accordingly we the members of Wexford County Council urge the government to 
have regard to Article 9 of the Lisbon Treaty, Recital 16 of the European Postal 
Directive and the necessity to avoid any undermining of the existing universal 
Service Obligation in transposing the EU’s ‘Third Postal Directive’ into Irish law.  
This is necessary to ensure that the private sector is not facilitated in cherry 
picking the more remunerative postal services as has happened in other countries 
which have liberalised their postal services.  This should not be permitted to 
happen in Ireland with resultant damage to the present community friendly and 
efficient state postal service.  

The above motions were agreed by the Council.

County Council Meeting 13.12.10 

Any Other Business: 

Snow Clearance: 

The meeting discussed the response of the Local Authority in snow clearance and 
related  matters  during  the  recent  difficult  weather  conditions.    Having  accepted  
the necessity of clearing national primary roads and a number of regional routes 
and  noting  the  limitations  on  resources  the  meeting  agreed  to  a  proposal  that 
where available the assistance of those in the rural communities in the county be 
utilised in snow clearance, salting and gritting of rural roads. 

The  Council  complimented  the  employees  and  staff  and  others  who  assisted  in 
snow clearance in the county.  

This concluded the business of the meeting.
