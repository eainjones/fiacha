The Members raised questions regarding taking in charge in Gorey and improvement works

Further  discussion  took  place  regarding  the  future  of Wexford  Local  Development.    Cllr.  G. 
Lawlor raised the issue regarding the old Wexford hospital which was now a derelict site and 
he  stated  that  it  would  cost  €400,000-€500,000  to  bring  the  building  back  to  non  derelict 
status.    On  the  proposal  of  Cllr.  G.  Lawlor,  seconded  by  Cllr.  P.  Kavanagh  the  Members 
requested that the Council write to the appropriate bodies to have Wexford Hospital delisted 
and  that  a  suitable  memorial  be  put  in  place  onsite  in  memory  of  the  residents  of  the

The Chairman asked that the Council deal with the minutes of the Planning SPC meeting of 
7th May and Cllr. D. MacPartlin’s motion regarding planning levies. 

Notices of Motion: 

Proposed by Cllr. D. MacPartlin: 

“In the context of planning levies that Wexford County Council will impose a charge of 
€100,000 per pylon designed to carry 400KV overhead cables and a similar charge for 
industrial wind farm turbines”. 

Cllr. M. Sheehan proposed an amendment to the motion which was seconded by Cllr. K. 
Doyle as follows: 

“In the context of planning levies that Wexford County Council will impose a charge of 
€100,000 per pylon per annum designed to carry 400KV overhead cables”. 

Mr. T. Larkin, Director of Services, set out the legal position regarding planning contributions 
used to fund infrastructure.  He advised the Members that a simple resolution as set out 
would not be adequate to achieve the objective.  A change to the contribution scheme 
requires public consultation.  He advised that the motion’s objective should be pursued 
through planning control measures rather than the development contribution scheme. In any 
event An Bord Pleanala will apply the planning contributions not Wexford County Council in 
respect of this development and he recommended that the Members did not proceed with the 
motion. 

A vote was taken and all Members voted in favour of the amended motion.

Proposed by Councillor G. Carthy seconded by Councillor A. Kelly. 

“That Wexford County Council call on the Minister for Health to address the Nursing 
and  Medical  Staff  shortages  in  the  new  Emergency  Department  at  Wexford  General 
Hospital.  The new Emergency Department at Wexford General Hospital is a “state of 
the  art”  facility  and  is  not,  to  date,  being  fully  utilized  in  the  context  of  the  full

an additional nine A & E nursing staff and at least two A & E Consultants to match the 
level of patient intake through the Emergency Department. 

The Full Pediatric unit is not open – all the A& E rooms are not open and there is an 
increased waiting time for Ambulance crews handing over patients, thereby putting 
additional pressure on the National Ambulance Service should emergency calls be 
stacked.” 

Following discussion and agreed by Cllr. G. Carthy the motion was amended as follows:  

“That  Wexford  County  Council  requests  a  deputation  to  the  Minister  for  Health  to 
address the Nursing and Medical Staff shortages in the new Emergency Department 
at  Wexford  General  Hospital.    The  new  Emergency  Department  at  Wexford  General 
Hospital  is  a  “state  of  the  art”  facility  and  is  not,  to  date,  being  fully  utilized  in  the 
context of the full footprint not being used due to staff shortages.   Wexford General 
Hospital  requires  an  additional  nine  A  &  E  nursing  staff  and  at  least  two  A  &  E 
Consultants to match the level of patient intake through the Emergency Department. 

The Full Pediatric unit is not open – all the A& E rooms are not open and there is an

Cllr. A. Kelly: 
“I move that this Council would call on the Minister for Health and the HSE to re-instate a 
24/7 Acute Mental Health Service/Unit in Wexford”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. A. Kelly, seconded by Cllr. D. Hynes  and agreed 
by the Council. 

Cllr. M. Roche: 
"I would call on this council to recognise that County Wexford, particularly rural areas, are in 
the midst of a crime epidemic, and to recognise that this council must step up to the mark 
and play a proactive role in making our communities feel safe again.  This Council should 
set up a taskforce to investigate the true economic cost of closing down Garda Stations and 
limiting Garda services across the county, to ensure that such downgrading ends and is 
reversed, to look at ways for the County Council to work more closely with community alert 
initiatives and to show people living in fear that they are not on their own." 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Roche, seconded by Cllr. A. Kelly.  On the 
proposal of Cllr. L. O’Brien seconded by Cllr. J. Moore and agreed by Cllr. M. Roche it was 
proposed that this motion be referred to the Joint Policing Committee for consideration. 

Cllr. M. Roche: 
"This County Council recognises that there are two different issues impacting upon the 
quality of service from the Fardystown Water Scheme in South Wexford.  The first is the a 
problem with hard water which is eroding household appliances and has been recognised 
by most members of this council.  The second has not been addressed and that is the 
supply of dirty, putrid water to many homes at irregular intervals.  Due to the chance nature 
of this, it makes running tests difficult and tests ran have proved negative in the past.  I 
move that a long-term investigation, testing random homes over a six month period across 
the supply lines is implemented immediately." 

The following motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Roche and seconded by Cllr. J. Mythen.  On 
the proposal of Cllr. J. Moore seconded by Cllr. L. O’Brien and agreed by Cllr. M. Roche 
this motion was referred to the Borough District of Wexford for consideration. 

Cllr. F. ÓSúilleabháin: 

"This Council notes with concern that in budgets over the past number of years there has 
been a severe cut in central government funding to Wexford County Council. 
Furthermore, this council notes that the new local government budgetary framework has 
been created and shaped by the same central government, to offload responsibility onto 
local councils - without a corresponding increase in local power over issues such as 
commercial rate reform, resolution of outstanding property development dues, and use of 
significant bargaining power inherent in the Rental Accommodation Scheme.

County Council Meeting 15.09.14 

Wexford County Council is calling on this County's TDs, and the government to: stop such 
cuts in Budget 2014; increase funding to a sufficient level for the provision of essential 
services; and increase local government power to enhance economic stimulus." 

This motion was proposed by Cllr. F.ÓSúilleabháin seconded by Cllr. M. Farrell and agreed 
by the Council. 

Cllr. J. Sullivan:

The  above  motion  was  proposed  by  Cllr.  J.  Fleming,  seconded  by  Cllr.  A.  Connick  and

ESB Broadband programme includes New Ross as part of their planned initial Provincial 
Town roll out and that consideration is given to include all the rural districts of the County, 
ensuring that each area has an equal opportunity to attract new investment, employment 
and enterprise”. 

This motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Sheehan seconded by Cllr. T. Dempsey and agreed 
by the Council to be amended as follows: 

“That this Council calls on the government to ensure the proposed Vodafone and 
ESB Broadband programme includes New Ross, Enniscorthy, Gorey and Wexford towns

County Council Meeting 15.09.14 

Cllr. M. Sheehan: 
“To minimise waiting times and reduce the backlog, and to recognise the benefits 
of addressing welfare applicants locally where the assessors can take account of the 
unique circumstances of each application, this Council calls on the Department of 
Social Protection to permit the needs and medical assessment of welfare applications to be 
done in the local offices rather than in central processing offices”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Sheehan, seconded by Cllr. A. Connick and 
approved by the Council. 

Cllr. J. Browne: 
“That Wexford County Council calls on the Department of Tourism and Bord Failte to create 
"The Ancient Ireland Way" for Wexford and the South East of Ireland. The huge investment 
by the government and Bord Failte into the Wild Atlantic Way has demonstrated how 
successful such a programme can be but once again Wexford and the South East have 
been left out”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Browne, seconded by Cllr. M. Whelan and 
agreed by the Council. 

Cllr. J. Browne: 
“That Wexford County Council expresses its outrage at the government for denying 
Wexford County Council the right to retain the full amount of local property tax it collected in 
County Wexford and furthermore this council calls on the government to allow Wexford 
County Council to target local property tax cuts to the most vulnerable and struggling 
families in County Wexford i.e. those whose homes fall into the lower and middle property 
tax bands”. 

The above motion was proposed by Cllr. J. Browne, seconded by Cllr. F. Kehoe. 

On the proposal of Cllr. O. O’Connell, seconded by Cllr. D. Hynes the motion was amended 
and agreed by the Council as follows:

County Wexford and furthermore this council calls on the government to allow Wexford 
County Council to target local property tax cuts to the most vulnerable and struggling 
families in County Wexford”. 

Cllr. D. Wadding: 
“That rent caps be increased to a level of parity with average rent prices to address the 
current situation where many are in a catch 22 unable to meet rent demands with their rent 
allowance and that this Council calls upon Government to allocate additional funding to 
alleviate the current crisis”. 

Cllr. D. Wadding withdrew this motion as it had been substantially dealt with earlier in the 
meeting.

County Council Meeting 15.09.14 

Cllr. D. Wadding:  
“That this council believes that water is a human right, a public good, one of life's essentials 
and that the introduction of an austerity charge for water will be disastrous not only to 
people's financial well-being to their health also. 

This council believes that the most efficient and fair way to pay for water is through general 
taxation, as it is at present; consequently, this council stands firmly against the introduction 
of water charges and will bring as much pressure to bear as possible on both Irish Water 
and the present government to ensure that their plan to double charge the people for water 
from 1st October is defeated.   

In pursuance of these demands this County Council pledges to support a major protest 
against water charges called by a coalition of trade unions and political parties to be held on 
Saturday 11th October 2014 to Dail Eireann”. 

On the proposal of Cllr. F. Kehoe seconded by Cllr. M. Sheehan and agreed by Cllr. D.

Apologies:

O. Walsh; D. Wadding 

Mr. T. Enright, Chief Executive, thanked the Members for their expressions of sympathy 
following  the  death  of  his  father  Johnnie.    He  also  expressed  his  sympathy  to  Cllr.  D. 
Wadding on the death of her father.  

Budget 2015: 

The Chief Executive introduced the Draft Budget 2015 with an overview of the Council’s 
financial position and highlighted the dramatic decline in income from both national and 
local sources since the beginning of the national economic recession. He stated that it 
has  only  been  through  the  introduction  of  cost  efficiency  measures,  significant  staff 
reductions and the commitment and dedication of staff that the Council has been able to 
maintain service levels at an acceptable and relatively high standard. 

The Chief Executive referred to the revenue deficit of €10.8m which has accrued over a 
number of years and indicated that he was hopeful that for 2014 he would be reporting a 
balanced position for the first time in a number of years, with no increase in the deficit 
which is a positive sign.  

He reiterated his intention to bring to the Council, during the lifespan of the Council and 
where circumstances permit, a budget which has the ability to reduce commercial rates 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statutory Budget Meeting 19.11.14 

for  businesses.  Wexford,  he  stated,  must  have  a  competitive  business  environment 
which is attractive to existing and new enterprise. 

He stated that 2015 will be about stabilising the Council’s finances and securing the cost 
efficiencies  of  the  merged  local  authority  and  on  that  basis  the  draft  budget  for  2015 
proposes to maintain commercial rates at the same rate as 2014 while also maintaining 
the Rates Incentive Scheme which provides for a reduction of up to 6% in rates. 

The  Chief  Executive  expressed  his  hope  that  with  an  improving  national  and  local 
economy in 2015 and the move from reporting a deficit in the Council’s finances that the 
council will be in a position to  be able to propose a commercial rate reduction in 2016 
but  indicated  that  this  was  dependent  on  central  government  funding  and  must  be 
balanced with investment in economic development in the county.    

He acknowledged and thanked Ms. A. O’Neill, Head of Finance, the Staff and Directors 
of Services for their input into the formation of the Draft Budget 2015.  He also thanked 
the  Corporate  Policy  Group  and  the  Budget Working Work for  their  involvement  in  the 
preparation of the Budget 2015. 

Ms. A. O’Neill, Head of Finance then gave a presentation which provided Members with 
an overview of the budget for 2015.  Proposal from Cllr. G. Lawlor and seconded by Cllr. 
J.  Hegarty  and  agreed  that  Wexford  County  Council  writes  to  the  Department  of 
Environment,  Community  &  Local  Government  regarding  the  difficulties  faced  by 
Members  in  applying  any  variation  to  the  level  of  refund  of  rates  for  vacant  properties 
under Part 5 of the Local Government Reform Act.  The requirement to apply any such 
variation to an entire local electoral area limits the ability of Members to target specific 
problem areas without penalising all ratepayers in the electoral area. 

Ms.  A.  O’Neill,  Head  of  Finance,  then  presented  the  details  of  the  Draft  Budget  under 
Divisions  A  to  H  which  was  considered  by  the  Members.    Questions  raised  by  the 
Members  regarding  the  figures  in  Divisions  A  to  H  were  answered  by  the  Head  of 
Finance and by Council Officials in attendance. 

Division B 

Following discussion regarding the Pay Parking programme the Chief Executive advised 
the Council that additional income generated by increasing the parking fee or extending 
parking areas will be reflected in budget allocation to the Municipal Districts. 

Division D 

Following discussion regarding Protected Structures it was agreed to refer the issue to 
the Strategic Policy Committee for further investigation.  

Division H 

Following  discussion  it  was  agreed  to  write  to  LAMA  and  the  AILG  to  ask  about  the 
services provided for the fee paid. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statutory Budget Meeting 19.11.14 

Adoption of Budget 2015: 

Two amendments to the Budget as presented were proposed as follows: 

Cllr. F. OSúilleabháin proposed that the School Warden budget be increased by €100K 
to be funded by a reduction in foreign travel.  

Cllr. J. Mythen proposed that the Homeless Budget be increased by €10K to be funded 
by a reduction in the amount allocated to Local Elections. 

Both of these motions were withdrawn on the assurances given by the Chief Executive 
that  the  Council  will  be  in  a  position  to  fund  School  Wardens  if  required.    Similarly, 
funding for homelessness was not required as the Council can recoup 90% of the cost 
of expenditure from the Department of Environment, Heritage & Local Government.  

On  the  proposal  of  Cllr.  M.  Whelan,  seconded  by  Cllr.  G.  Lawlor  and  agreed  by  the 
Council that there would be no variation for 2015 on rates to vacant premises. 

On  the  proposal  of  Cllr.  F.  Kehoe  seconded  by  Cllr.  M.  Sheehan  and  agreed  by  the 
Council that the Base Rate for Year 1 (2015) would be €71.52. 

Following  discussion  by  the  Members  it  was  proposed  by  Cllr.  M.  Sheehan,  seconded 
by  Cllr.  L.  O’Brien,  and  agreed  by  the  Members  in  attendance,  that  Wexford  County 
Council adopt for the financial year ending 31st  December, 2015, the draft budget as set 
out  in  tables  A  to  F  of  the  prescribed  form  of  Budget  prepared  in  accordance  with  the 
Local Government Act 2001 (as amended) and Local Government Financial Procedures 
and Audit Regulations 2002 and that Wexford County Council determine in accordance 
with the budget for the financial year ending 31 December 2015, the general annual rate 
on valuation of €71.52 as set out and adjusted in line with the requirements of Section 
29 of the Local Government Reform Act concerning the harmonisation of rates .
