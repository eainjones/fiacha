1. 

Consideration of draft County Wexford Development Plan 2021-2027 and Chief Executive’s 
Report on submission received to the draft Plan 

Chief Executive Tom Enright addressed the Members and pointed out that the Members’ 
role in reviewing and adopting a Development Plan was one of the most important of all 
reserved functions of the Elected Members. He reminded the members that the plan was 
not the Executive’s plan, but was the Members plan, to review, amend, and agree as the 
Members saw fit. 

Mr. Enright advised the Members that the Council was now at Stage 8 of a possible 13-stage 
process to review the Development Plan and that when the Plan was eventually adopted 
and in place, it would be followed by the process of reviewing and adopting a series of Local 
Area Plans for the larger settlement areas within the county. 

Mr.  T.  Larkin,  DoS  introduced  the  draft  Plan  and  the  accompanying  Report  of  the  Chief 
Executive.  He  pointed  out  that  the  draft  Plan  sought  to  achieve  a  balance  between  the 
protection  of  the  environment,  amenities  and  landscape  and  the  need  to  promote  and 
accommodate  sustainable  economic,  social  and  community  growth.  Mr.  Larkin  drew  the 
attention of the Members to the constraints on development brought about by limited water 
and sewerage capacity in towns and villages all across the county. 

Mr. Diarmuid Houston Senior Planner than addressed the meeting and presented in detail 
the  Report  of  the  Chief  Executive.  The  Report  listed  and  considered  each  of  the  168 
submissions received following the public consultation process and outlined the views of the 
Executive in relation to each of those submissions. Mr. Houston drew the Members attention 
to the submission of the Planning Regulator in particular and outlined the main provisions 
of the submission to the Members for their consideration. 

There followed a robust and extensive debate to which all Members contributed. Among the 
views expressed and concerns raised by the Members were the following:  

•  One-off  rural  housing  is  necessary  for  the  continued  growth  and  development  of 
rural communities and should be facilitated and allowed in certain circumstances. 

•  The desire of those seeking to build in town and village settlements is significantly 

constrained by water and sewerage capacity within those settlements 

•  The town and village housing densities suggested by the PR are not appropriate in a 

rural county such as Wexford

Special County Council Meeting 26.04.21 

•  The absence of national guidelines to regulate the development of solar energy farms 

is of concern 

•  The increase in public demand for remote working which has been brought about by 
Covid-19  is  contrary  to  the  preference  expressed  by  the  PR  to  encourage 
development in the larger towns. 

•  The expression “economic need” as described in the draft Plan requires clarification 

and definition. 

•  The  scale  and  complexity  of  the  submissions  and  the  Chief  Executive’s  Report  on 
same  requires  considerable effort  and  input  by  the Members  in  order  to  properly 
consider same. It was proposed that independent expert planning advice be funded 
and made available to the Members to assist them in their deliberations 

Following discussion in relation to the last point above, it was agreed that the Council would meet 
in  smaller  groups  (by  political  party/smaller  party/non-party  groups  and  by  Municipal/Borough 
District) to comprehensively consider and review the draft Development Plan and the accompanying 
Chief Executive’s Report.  

The  proposal  to  fund  and  provide  independent  expert  planning  advice  to  the  Members  will  be 
reconsidered following these meetings. 

THIS CONCLUDED THE BUSINESS OF THE MEETING
