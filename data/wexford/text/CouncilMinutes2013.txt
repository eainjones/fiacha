briefed the Elected Members on the Grid Link Project an estimated €500m electricity 
transition project that will deliver a wide range of benefits to the national and regional 
economy.  The development will involve the construction of a new power line linking 
Leinster and Munster as part of Grid 25, a €3.2 billion investment in developing and 
upgrading Ireland’s electricity transmission grid.  The Council were informed that 
Eirgrid had carried out a detailed analysis of the national transmission grid to identify 
the level of reinforcement required to ensure and secure electricity supply and to 
enable the country achieve its renewable energy targets.  The analysis had identified 
a capacity shortfall in the south and east.  The meeting was informed that the project 
is a vital development strengthening the electricity supply across the south and east 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
County Council Meeting 14.01.13 

of the country that will help ensure and secure electricity supply to the future needs of 
the region and will enable Ireland to meet its renewable energy targets and help 
empower economic growth. 

He further added that a strong energy infrastructure is key to the success of 
Wexford’s large industries and suppliers such as Wexford Creamery and international 
companies such as Coca Cola and Waters Technology.  The Grid Link Project will be 
a platform for economic growth in Wexford by providing existing businesses with a 
secure future supply of electricity and to attracting new indigenous and foreign 
investment.  It will help Ireland to shift from a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels 
to more sustainable sources of energy and will ensure the most efficient electricity 
generators in the south and east are utilised in the most effective way. 

Mr. Lowry advised the meeting that the Project Team will continue to undertake 
detailed studies and extensive public consultation over the coming years to 
determine the factors that will influence the eventual route that the line will take.  
Eirgrid does not expect to submit an application to An Bord Pleanála for planning 
approval before 2015 and public consultation will form an important part of all stages 
of the project over the coming years.  Members of the public are encouraged to 
engage with the project team through the New Ross Information Centre open every 
Wednesday from 12 noon to 6pm, and through a dedicated phone line 1890 422 122, 
email to gridlink@eirgrid.com or in writing to The Grid Link Project Manager, PO Box 
12213, Glenageary, Co. Dublin. 

Following his presentation and the circulation of an information booklet Mr. Lowry 
responded to various questions on the project raised by the Elected Members.  Mr. 
Lowry and his colleagues at Eirgrid were also invited to attend a future meeting of the 
Local Authority as the project advances.  Mr. Lowry and Mr. Donnelly then withdrew

independent Port Authority with a mandate to develop the range and extent of 
business activity in Rosslare Europort given its primary focus on RoRo and 
Passenger traffic. 

Following discussion on the proposal of Cllr. T. Dempsey seconded by Cllr. P. Codd 
the Council approved and endorsed the report and its content which clearly identified 
the potential to grow RoRo business, improve tourism throughput and enhance the 
passenger experience in the Port.  The report also identified the potential for 
significant employment in areas such as wind energy logistics, cruise shipping and 
the Council again outlined its commitment to doing whatever is necessary in order to 
encourage investment and expansion in the Port and its activities which would be 
supported by the County Council in planning, zoning and the provision of improved 
infrastructural services.

County Council Meeting 11.03.13 

Presentation by Mr. Paul Bradley and Mr. Jim Outram, Eircom, on the 
broadband fibre network rollout in County Wexford. 

Mr. Paul Bradley, Eircom, circulated documentation and made a presentation to the 
meeting on the broadband fibre network rollout throughout County Wexford.  In the 
presentation Mr. Bradley highlighted the investment plans of Eircom for its customers 
in County Wexford by Ireland’s leading provider of fixed and mobile 
telecommunications.  He referred to the 2.4m fixed and mobile customers, the 
extensive telecommunications network in Ireland, the employment of approx 6,500 
staff and contractors with an investment of approx €1m every working day in Ireland. 

Future investment plans for Ireland and Eircom customers would involve the 
installation of fibre broadband to 1.2m premises by June 2015 in addition to building 
capacity, continued construction and the modernisation of business with continue 
efficiency.  The meeting was also advised of the broadband footprint in County 
Wexford, the timetable for the extension of the fibre network rollout throughout the 
county in addition to the benefits for home users and benefits for businesses arising 
from the proposed fibre network rollout and installation.  The meeting was also 
informed of the increased usage of the internet with annual average usage of GBs 
increasing from 40 in 2010 to 90 in 2013.  Plans for the Wexford fibre footprint rollout 
were Wexford (Live Pilot) December 2013, Wexford Anne St (Live Pilot) December 
2013, Enniscorthy December 2013, Gorey December 2013, Drinagh December 2014, 
New Ross December 2014, Barntown June 2015, Bunclody June 2015, Courtown 
Harbour June 2015. 

In conclusion Mr. Bradley and Mr. Outram sought the Council’s co-operation and 
assistance in order to help Eircom achieve the fibre plans for the county including the 
installatiom of 56 cabinets in the first phase with the building of fibre and power to 
each cabinet.  This would enable 14,000 premises in the area to have super fast 
broadband and he emphasised the importance of working with the Local Authority to 
ensure the insulation happens efficiently and quickly.  The Eircom Officials suggested 
that the best process for approval of cabinet locations would be by dealing with bulk 
applications, having a single point of contact and speedy turnaround times.  In 
conclusion both Eircom representatives thanked the Council for the opportunity to 
make the presentation and looked forward to working successfully with the Local 
Authority and its Officials.  The co-operation of Mr. Tony Larkin, Director of Services, 
and Mr. Padraig O’Gorman, Administrative Officer, was also acknowledged during 
the presentation.  

Mr. Bradley and Mr. Outram responded to a number of questions in relation to 
various technical aspects of the fibre rollout programme.  It was agreed that each 
electoral area district committee would be further advised of plans for each area.  
Following discussion and having dealt comprehensively with the questions raised by 
the Members both Eircom Officials were thanked by the Cathaoirleach for attending

Notice of Motion 

The following motion was proposed by Cllr. M. Byrne: 

"Recognising the significant number of unfinished estates in Co. Wexford and the 
difficulties that have been faced for a number of years by the residents of these 
estates, that Wexford County Council resolves to 

(i) 

(ii) 

(iii) 

demand payment of all outstanding development levies due prior to 
31st  
December 2012, and that such payment must be made by 31st 
December, 2013 and pursues such payment by whatever legal means 
necessary 

utilise such payments to complete works left unfinished by same 
developers 

cease any 'softly, softly' approach toward developers who fail to 
substantially co-operate with the County Council in the completion of 
estates 

(iv)   publish the names of companies and their directors against whom the 
Council is forced to take court action and the reasons for such actions, 
on the County Council website and in monthly reports to Members." 

In response the County Manager rejected the softly softly approach to developers 
referred to by Cllr. Byrne in the motion and disagreed with the suggestion of the 
protection of certain developers and he also advised the Council that payments made 
in respect of levies could not be utilised to complete works on unfinished housing 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
County Council Meeting 08.04.13 

estates.  The Manager considered that the motion was most inappropriate and ill 
timed.   

Mr. E. Hore, Director of Services, advised the meeting on enforcement proceedings 
taken against developers with resultant responses.  He also outlined the difficulties in 
attempting to collect outstanding levies from individuals in these difficult and 
challenging times.   

Following discussion the County Manager indicated that he would arrange for a 
presentation on outstanding levies to be made to the May County Council Meeting 
which would assist Members in finally establishing the current level of indebtedness 
and determine the policy to be pursued by the Council in resolving this matter 

The following motions were deferred to the next meeting of the Council. 

Cllr. M. Sheehan: 

“That this Council expresses our opposition to the 55% cut in the Disability Grants 
and Housing Adaptation Grants and call on the Minister for their immediate 
restoration to enable residents to live in their own homes with dignity and as a jobs 
activation measure to ensure the viability of local contractors. Furthermore, we 
congratulate the efficiency of the officials in dealing with the applications, this Council 
agrees to continue to accept applications as per normal”. 

 Cllr. M. Sheehan: 

“That this Council calls on the Minister for Social Protection to decentralise the 
assessment and application procedures to allow Local Health Clinics and Health 
Nurses assess medical/ social service applications such as Disability Allowance, 
Benefit, Carers Allowance and the associated Appeals as a means to ensure those in 
need receive the grant without undue delay, backlogs and distress”. 

This concluded the business of the meeting.

2014,  Wexford  Town  &  Environs  Development  Plan  2009-2015  and  the  New  Ross 
Town  &  Environs  Development  Plan  2011-2017  to  accommodate  the  Joint  Housing 
Strategy  for  areas  of  those  plans  and  to  make  a  number  of  changes  to  the  written

variations  to  the  Wexford,  Enniscorthy  and  New  Ross  Town  and  Environs

Presentation by Ms. A. O’Neill, Head of Finance – Development Contributions – 
Debtors Project: 

The Head of Finance gave a presentation on the Development Contributions – 
Debtors Project to the meeting.  The Head of Finance advised that the focus of this 
joint Finance/Planning Project is to establish the exact level of Planning Levies due 
for payment to the council, to categorise monies due to either short term or long term 
debt and to ensure a robust but flexible collection regime. 

The Head of Finance also highlighted the ongoing level of collection of planning 
levies, a total of €6.4m has been collected from 2010 to 2012.  Ms. O’Neill also 
outlined that a significant portion of the current balance on the planning debtors 
records will not fall due as developments either failed to be fully completed and/or 
planning permissions expired before any development takes place.  This trend is 
reflected in the Council’s Annual Financial Statements showing a drop from €23.2m 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
County Council Meeting 13.05.13 

in 2011 to €17.7m in 2012.  The Head of Finance confirmed that the current project 
will continue until all the debtor accounts have been fully reviewed.  The Head of 
Finance responded to questions raised by the Members in relation to the payment of 
levies by installment, the calling in of bonds to complete unfinished developments 
and processes being followed in dealing with Receivers, Liquidators and NAMA in 
pursuance of development levies due.  The County Manager also advised the 
Members of the tradition in Wexford where developers paid levies as dwellings were 
sold and that in general levies due on houses sold were paid in full. 

The Cathaoirleach thanked the Head of Finance for her presentation and the 
Members welcomed the clarity of the presentation and emphasised the need for a 
flexible collection system.

Presentation by Ms. M. Melia, Chief Fire Officer – Keeping Community Safe 

The  Chief  Fire  Officer,  Ms.  M.  Melia  made  a  presentation  to  the  meeting  on  keeping  the 
community safe, a framework for fire safety in Ireland which arose from a government policy 
document  which  was  published in February  2013.  The Chief Fire Officer outlined the main 
aspects of keeping communities safe and also referred to the following:-

(cid:1) 

Implications for Wexford 
Implementation and timescales 

The  main  aspect  of  keeping  communities  safe  in  the  area  of  risk  management  was 
prevention, protection and response time in addition to the reform of fire service delivery units 
which will result in the reduction from 13 to 21 fire services delivery units caring for population 
broadly in the range of 120,000 to 200,000 and improvement in the co-ordination of response 
in the new eight regions. 

While highlighting the fire safety roles for society the Chief Fire Officer referred to community 
fire safety, technical fire safety, dangerous substances, major emergency management and 
the  operational  response  of  the  Fire  Service  in  the  County.    The  Chief  Fire  Officers  also 
outlined  priorities  and  targets  both  national  and  local  for  the  fire  services  in  addition  to 
outlining the details of the new fire service delivery units county wide.  The Chief Fire Officer 
advised  that  it  would  be  necessary  to  draw  up  a  fire  and  emergency  operation  plan  in 
compliance with Section 26 of the Fire Services Act which necessitated each fire authority to 
prepare  plans  for  fire  and  emergency  operations  showing  the  provisions  made  for  dealing 
with  operations  of  a  emergency  nature.    This  matter  was  a  reserved  function  and  it  was 
proposed  that  the  plan  be  adopted  by  the  Council  in  April  2014.    The  implementation 
timescales  for  the  adoption  of  the  plan  were  outlined  in  the  presentation  by  the  Chief  Fire 
Officer. 

The Chief Fire Officer responded to various questions raised by the members on the contents 
of  the  presentation  at  which  the  importance  of  carrying  out  regular  fire  safety  checks  on 
buildings  was  emphasised  by  many  members.    The  meeting  acknowledged  the  excellent 
work carried out by the Chief Fire Officer, her colleagues and the members of the fire service 
who are continuing to provide an important service to the people of Wexford and responding 
competently to many emergency issues that have to be addressed. 

Presentation on Unfinished Housing Estates – Mr. Sean Kavanagh 

Mr. Sean Kavanagh, Senior Executive Engineer, Building Control made a presentation to the 
meeting  on  unfinished  housing  estates  in  County  Wexford.    The  presentation  outlined 
progress  made  since  the  national  housing  development  survey  carried  out  in  October  2010 
which identified 177 unfinished housing estates within County Wexford.  The housing estates 
identified included 39 rural clusters and were distributed county-wide as follows:- 

Gorey Area    
Wexford Area 
New Ross Area 
Enniscorthy Area 

59 housing estates 
49 housing estates 
38 housing estates 
31 housing estates

The  presentation  advised  that  to-date  twenty  developments  had  been  taken  in  charge  and 
there  were  presently  106  applications  including  21  unfinished  housing  developments 
currently being dealt with by the local authority with the break down of applications as follows:

Total:   

         106 

Mr.  Kavanagh  also  confirmed  that  14  other  housing  estates  not  on  the  unfinished  housing 
development list had been brought to the local authorities attention through complaints from 
the public, representations from elected members, enforcement, site inspection and the water 
services  department.    The  meeting  was  advised  that  the  local  authorities  had  a  dedicated 
unfinished  housing  estates  team  in  place  which  have  highlighted  and  rectified  public  safety 
issues,  developed  site  resolution  plans  and  in  addition  to  meeting  developers,  residents, 
liquidators and the health & safety authority and financiers had in a number of cases secured 
bonds  where  these  were  available  to  assist  with  the  completion  of  developments.    Mr. 
Kavanagh’s  presentation  also  contained  photographs  and  evidence  of  improvements  works 
carried out on various unfinished estates throughout the county. 

Cash bonds approved and released to fund works in 2012 exceeded €290,000 and in 2013 
€574,000.  The estimate expenditure to date on approved works was of the order €460,000.  
In conclusion Mr. Kavanagh noted that the challenges now facing the council  were financial 
constraints, running out of time to deal with the developers before they go into receivership or 
liquidation, renewal of bonds, calling in of security bonds, resources, waste water treatment 
plants  and  pumping  stations  not  functioning,  problems  with  public  lighting  and  insufficient 
bonds  to  complete  works.    The  Cathaoirleach  Councillor  Kathleen  Codd-Nolan  and  the 
County Manager Mr. A. Doyle complimented Mr. Kavanagh and the Director of Services Mr. 
E. Hore on an excellent presentation which clearly demonstrated the issues that the Council 
would  have  to  deal  with  in  financing  and  dealing  with  the  completion  of  unfinished  housing 
estates county-wide. 

Mr. Kavanagh also responded to various questions raised by the members on the content of 
the  report  where  it  was  accepted  that  this  was  a  matter  that  would  have  to  be  addressed 
again and on a regular basis by the local authority to conclusion.

•  The council congratulated the senior footballers and hurlers on their recent successes

forward new rules for tenants and landlords availing of rent allowance 

a)  That rent allowance be suspended if the tenant engages in anti-social behavior within 

the housing estate in which they live 

b)  That rent allowance be withdrawn indefinitely if they continue to engage in anti social 

behavior 

c)  That  the  landlord  whose  property  is  consistently  involved  in  such  behavior  also  be

“That this Council calls on Minister Joan Burton and Junior Minister Jan O’Sullivan to find a 
mechanism for tenants and landlords availing of rent allowance to provide that: 

a)  Rent allowance be suspended if the tenant engages in anti social behavior within the 

housing estate in which they live. 

b)  That rent allowance be withdrawn indefinitely if they continue to engage in anti social

support  an  EU  level  greater  liberalisation  of  the  haulage  industry  in  Europe  and,  in 
particular, the opening up of cabotage within all member states.  If change at EU level is

to  the  opening  of  the  new  library  at  Mallin  Street  which  was  the  first  major  event  the

Annual Meeting of Wexford County Council 28.06.13 

Councillor  Codd-Nolan  acknowledged  the  many  years  of  public  service  given  by  the 
former  County  Manager,  Mr.  Eddie  Breen  who  retired  in  November  2012  and  whose 
activities invigorated the development of the county and who has now been succeeded 
by Mr. Adrian Doyle  who  will no doubt bring  new ideas to the role  of County  Manager 
and whose efforts and activities will bring benefits to the county and its people. 

The  Cathaoirleach  also  acknowledged  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Enterprise  and 
Community Sections  of the local authority,  and  paid  tribute to the  environment section 
on  the  holding  of the  annual  environmental  awards  in  addition  to  highlighting  two  very 
special  events  which  were  held  during  the  year,  the  hosting  of  the  Wexford  Olympian 
Athletes  and  the  Honouring  of  the  Wexford  All  Ireland  Senior  Camogie  Team  who 
achieved success three years in a row. 

In conclusion the Cathaoirleach highlighted the JFK celebrations held in New Ross last 
week  end  and  the  interaction  with  the  wider  Kennedy  Family  and  the  many  guests 
invited to New Ross for the celebrations.   

The  Cathaoirleach  acknowledged  the  support  given  by  Mr.  Adrian  Doyle,  County 
Manager and by the Directors of Services and the various staff members throughout the 
organisation who had  been very supportive of the Cathaoirleach and the Council over 
the past year. 

Councillor  Codd-Nolan  thanked  the  Vice-Chairman,  Councillor  Robbie  Ireton  and  the 
Members  for  their  support  and  looked  forward  to  working  with  the  incoming 
Cathaoirleach and the Council in the final year of the present Council. 

The  County  Manager  and  Members  thanked  the  Cathaoirleach  for  her  positive 
contribution  during  the  year  and  looked  forward  to  working  together  in  continuing  to 
promote the county and in facing positively into the challenges arising from the changes 
in the local government structures now being implemented. 

Election of Cathaoirleach: 

Councillor G. Lawlor  proposed and Councillor  Robbie Ireton seconded that Councillor 
Ted Howlin be elected Cathaoirleach.     There being no other proposals, Councillor Ted 
Howlin was elected Cathaoirleach of the County Council.  

Councillor Ted Howlin, Cathaoirleach, thanked the Council for their support and stated 
that  he  was  honoured  and  privileged  to  be  elected  Cathaoirleach  and  thanked  his 
proposed Councillor George Lawlor and seconder Councillor Robbie Ireton. 

Councillor  Howlin  referred  to  the  considerable  time  since  a  labour  member  held  office 
and he was honoured to be following in the distinguished footsteps of members such as 
Tommy Byrne, Nick Corish, Andy Doyle and many others who have graced the office in 
former  times.    He  also  hoped  to  live  up  to  the  high  standards  created  by  the  former 
office  holders.    The  Cathaoirleach  referred  to  the  challenging  and  changing  times and 
looked  forward  to  working  with  a  much  expanded  Council  in  the  years  ahead  which

Annual Meeting of Wexford County Council 28.06.13 

He looked forward over the next twelve months in preparing for change and working to 
ensure  that  the  new  structure  best  served  the  people  of  County  Wexford.    The 
Cathaoirleach referred to the important role that the local authority has to play in making 
the  County  attractive  for  inward  investment,  tourism,  and  to  help  sustain  jobs  that  we 
have in agriculture, fisheries, manufacturing services and retail.  The enormous amount 
of positives was outlined by the Cathaoirleach and the importance of improving the road 
link  to  Dublin,  Cork  and  Limerick  in  addition  to  driving  the  development  of  Rosslare 
Europort  was  emphasised  by  Councillor  Howlin.    The  attractiveness  of  the  arts  as  a 
driver  of  visitor  numbers  was  highlighted  by  the  Cathaoirleach  who  had  been  involved 
for many years with Wexford Festival Opera.   

In  conclusion  the  Cathaoirleach  paid  tribute  to  the  outgoing  Cathaoirleach  Councillor 
Kathleen  Codd-Nolan  and  the  Leas  Cathaoirleach  Councillor  Robbie  Ireton  for  their 
work during the year. 

The  Members  and  the  County  Manager  on  behalf  of  the  Staff  complimented  and 
congratulated the Cathaoirleach and stated that they looked forward to working together 
in meeting the challenges facing the Council and County over the next year. 

Election of Leas-Cathaoirleach: 

Councillor  Robbie  Ireton  proposed  and  Councillor  George  Lawlor  seconded  that 
Councillor Pat Cody be elected Leas-Cathaoirleach. 

As there were no further nominations Councillor P. Cody was unanimously elected Leas 
Cathaoirleach of the County Council. 

Councillor P. Cody thanked the Members for their support. 

This concluded the business of the meeting.

Presentation – Irish Water: 

A presentation on Irish Water and Wexford County Council’s Water Services Operations was 
made  to  the  meeting  by  Mr.  E.  Taaffe,  Director  of  Services.    The  Director  summarised  the 
activities of Wexford County Council’s water  and  waste  water services serving  a  population 
countywide  in  excess  of  104,000.    The  major  public  water  supply  schemes  in  the  county  in 
addition to serving the county’s population supplied over 40m cubic meters of water per day 
through1800 km of public water mains, the nine major supply schemes meeting 92% of the 
county’s demand. 

The water supply is further supplemented through a number of small schemes countywide. 

The Director in his presentation also advised that there were 67 public waste water treatment 
systems  operational  in  the  county  with  a  collection  network  of  580km  of  public  sewer.  
Significantly 83 employees were working on the operational services in both water and waste 
water services, inclusive of administrative staff and engineering professionals in this area.  It 
was  noted  that  the  water  service  budget  for  2013  exceed  €18.1m  which  is  approximately 
19.6%  of  the  revenue  budget  of  €92.4m.    In  his  presentation  the  Director  also  referred  to 
Government policy on water reform, clearly indicated the timescale for the implementation of 
the programme for Irish Water and he also confirmed that after March 2013 Bord Gais would 
have  legal  responsibility  to  establish  a  new  company  Irish  Water  and  to  provide  for  the 
installation of water meters countywide. 

The metering programme which was now underway had a target of the installation of 27,000 
meters  countrywide  per  month  with  the  installation  of  meters  taking  place  very  early 
throughout  County  Wexford.    It  was  likely  that  metering  in  the  county  would  commence  in 
July and August 2013 commencing in the county’s main towns.  The Director confirmed that 
there  were  approximately  46,000  domestic  connections  in  County  Wexford  in  addition  to 
8000  non  domestic  connections.    He  also  confirmed  that Wexford  was  a  pilot  county  along 
with  Fingal,  Kerry  and  Kildare  and  that  its  customers  would  be  given  prior  notification  in 
advance  of  metering  installation  and  that  all  customer  contact  would  be  via  the  Irish Water 
Call  Centre.    Domestic  water  charges  were  set  to  be  introduced  in  January  2015.    The 
Director also advised that Wexford County Council would operate water functions by way of 
service level agreement on behalf of Irish Water for a period of approximately 12 years.

of a new plan for the area.  The first stage of this process consisted of the pre-draft 
consultation with the public, prescribed bodies, interested groups, stakeholders and 
infrastructural providers.  This stage has now been completed and the report circulated

Report of Corporate Policy Group: 

The report of the Corporate Policy Group was noted by the meeting.  The County Manager 
Mr. A. Doyle and the A/Head of Finance Ms. L. Lacey responded to questions raised by the 
Members on the quarterly Financial Report to 30th June 2013 and in particular on the revenue 
and capital income and expenditure summaries circulated.  The Manager also responded to 
Members  questions  arising  from  the  Local  Government  transition  proposals  and  its 
implications for current rating authorities in the county.  The County Manager advised that the 
2014 budget would be prepared and presented as in previous years and he advised that he 
was not in a  position at this point in time to give any assurances  as regards rate variations 
arising from questions raised on the equalisation on the county rate.  Following discussion it 
was  agreed  to  give  these  matters  further consideration  following  the  finalisation  of  the  draft 
legislation  when  the  impacts  on  the  County  Council  and  Municipal  Districts  will  be  more 
easily determined. 

Presentation – Economic Development Section 2013-2014: 

A report of the Director of Economic Development Mr. T. Larkin entitled “Supporting 
Enterprise, Local Development and Economic Growth” was presented to the meeting.  The 
Deputy County Manager advised that the Economic Workplan 2013-2014 is the latest in a 
succession of plans prepared and approved by the County Council beginning with the 
“Wexford Enterprise Initiative Report” and most recently the “Positioning Wexford for the 
Upturn” plan.  This current plan will replace previous plans when adopted.  The meeting was 
advised that previous plans had placed a heavy emphasis on inter-agency progress but the 
current proposal is focused entirely on Wexford County Council’s Actions which can be dealt 
with by the Council’s own Economic Development Team with a high degree of certainty.  The 
meeting noted that the plan has a short focus of 2 years as the Local Authority is now

County Council Meeting 09.09.13 

entering a time of significant change in Local Government with the abolition of the Town 
Authorities, the merging of County Enterprise Boards into Local Government and the 
formation of new socio-economic committees to replace existing County Development Board 
structures at the interface of Local Government and Local Development.  The Director also 
envisaged a review of economic planning in the 2nd half of 2014 following the integration of 
these new structures where the incoming Council can establish its agenda for economic 
development.  The aim of the plan is to maximise the impact the County Council can have on 
growth in the County given the resources and measures available at the present time. 

In the report presented to the meeting the Director of Services also referred to the enhanced 
role in economic development for the Council, highlighted the success of previous economic 
plans and emphasised that the current plan would primarily focus on actions to be delivered 
by the County Council through the Economic Development Unit.  The report presented also 
referred to the significant shortage of land and buildings, suggested the strategic disposal of 
Council lands in order to realise capital for re-investment and welcomed the provision of 
broadband and natural gas in addition to the upgrading of the electricity supply system 
through GridLink in addition to Port developments at Rosslare and New Ross which would 
enhance the enterprise infrastructure within the county.  Other specific actions to support 
Enterprise, Local Development and Economic Growth in County Wexford in the areas of 
Tourism Development, Economic Promotion and Business Networking were also presented 
to the meeting. 

Following discussion of the Economic Workplan and the report prepared by the Director of 
Services, the Council acknowledged the importance of the Council and its efforts in 
promoting economic development in order to combat the high levels of unemployment in the 
current climate and recommended the adoption of the Economic Workplan 2013-2014 as 
presented to the meeting by the Director of Services Mr. T. Larkin.

County Council Meeting 09.09.13 

Proposed by Councillor T. Dempsey seconded by Councillor P. Codd: 

“The 9% VAT rate for restaurants is under extreme threat in the October Budget.  We need 
your help by contacting your local councillors and asking them to Submit a Motion for the 
Sept Council Meeting.   This Local Authority supports the campaign of the Restaurants 
Association of Ireland to keep the VAT rate for tourism and hospitality at 9% into 2014 and 
beyond”. 

This motion was unanimously agreed by the Council.  

Proposed by Councillor G. Lawlor seconded by Councillor M. Kinsella: 

“That this Council endorses the principle of the right to water and sanitation as a fundamental 
core value within Irish society and this should be reflected as a central pillar in national water 
policy. As citizens  of the EU  we  believe in the right of all inhabitants to enjoy this right  and 
that we oppose any attempt to include water in legislation aimed at market liberalisation. This 
Council supports the call for the full national political commitment to ensuring that water and 
sanitation  are  publicly  owned,  democratically  run  and  that  all  in  the  sector  are  fully 
accountable”. 

This motion was unanimously agreed by the Council.  The Council also requested that this 
motion be circulated to all Local Authorities. 

Proposed by Councillor P. Reck seconded by Councillor T. Dempsey: 

“In an effort to improve the lives and wellbeing of our Deaf and Hard of hearing citizens, that 
this Council calls on the Government to give official recognition status to ISL, Irish Sign 
Language.  Furthermore, in the context of both enhancing the lives of our deaf and hard of 
hearing citizens and adhering to the spirit and ethos of the United Nations Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities that Wexford County Council calls on the Government to 
give official recognition status to Irish Sign Language (ISL) especially to Article 21 that states 
‘recognising and promoting the use of sign language most likely requiring implementing 
legislation’. Also Article 24-3b ‘facilitating the learning of sign language and the promotion of 
the linguistic identity of the deaf community”. 

This motion was agreed by the Council.
