County Council Meeting 10.01.11 

Update and Presentation on the provision of services during recent 
severe weather: 

Mr. N. McGuigan, Director of Services, made a presentation to the meeting on 
the Water and Environment services response during the recent severe 
weather.  In his presentation Mr. McGuigan referred to the successful inter-
agency co-ordination nationally, regionally and countywide.  He outlined how 
the severe weather response plan was activated for the duration of the poor 
weather, that Wexford County Council Crisis Team was formed and met as 
required with regular South East Radio interviews and updates.  He 
acknowledged the efforts of the Civil Defence Volunteers, the Roads, Housing 
and Fire Services Staff and the excellent working relationship with the Urban 
Authorities.  

In addition to the Refuse Collection being severely disrupted, he highlighted 
the severe problems that occurred following the thaw with water scarcity in 
Castlebridge, Oilgate, Curracloe, Gorey, Kilmuckridge, The Hook and 
Enniscorthy Town. 

He acknowledged the excellent work of the staff in locating and fixing leaks 
and maintaining services despite dramatically increased water usage.  He 
confirmed that a significant number of leaks were on the public supply but the 
overwhelming problems and number of leaks were generally on the customer 
side with problems being caused by shallow service pipes, un-insulated 
internal plumbing and temporarily vacated businesses and homes.  
Communication with the public was maintained by a 24 hour call centre, by 
the use of the web page and twitter in addition to South East Radio updates 
and interview and advice on the County Council website.  

In conclusion he advised that generally the public should check their water 
meters, turn off the water supply and insulate pipes and fittings in order to 
prevent the reoccurrence of problems in any further cold spell.  

The Director of Service, Mr. Adrian Doyle, made a presentation to the meeting 
on the Roads Section response during the recent severe weather.  He 
highlighted the priority given to the national routes and a section of the 
regional roads during the severe weather.  He confirmed that over 3,200 
tonnes of salt were spread on Priority 1 and 2 routes and that 10,000 tonnes 
of salt were spread on the non-national roads.  He confirmed that there were 
no closures on the national routes and that 5 gritting trucks were operational 
from 4am to 12 midnight each day for over 30 days continuously.  The 
Director outlined the current resources both internal and external available to 
the Local Authority in combating the problems encountered with severe snow 
and ice.  The use of Glanbia and Wexford Farmers Co-Op depots throughout 
the county were invaluable in facilitating the delivery of grit to rural areas.  
Arrangements have also now been made to purchase 3 snow blades to be 
based at the Machinery Yard, the new salt barn was under construction at 
Whitemill, Wexford which will increase storage from 500 tonnes to 1500 
tonnes and 15 snow blades were being made available to agricultural 
contractors for use countywide. 

 
 
 
 
 
County Council Meeting 10.01.11 

He acknowledged the importance of removing snow as soon as possible, that 
more salt storage facilities were required and the importance of the Town 
Council’s working with local business to clear footpaths.  An improved co-
ordination of the school transport system was also essential.  He indicated 
that it would now be necessary to review the Blizzard Plan in order to 
encompass non-national roads, main towns and areas of economic 
importance in the county. 

Both the Directors of Services responded to a number of questions raised by 
the Members following the presentation.  The Members acknowledged the 
works carried out by the Council Staff during the Christmas period and also 
acknowledged the efforts of the wider community in helping clear footpaths, 
roadways, and their general good neighborliness.    

During discussion the Cathaoirleach, Cllr. M. Kinsella, referred to the 
importance of the road from Craanford to Gorey and requested that a traffic 
survey of the road be carried out which would highlight the usage and 
importance of this roadway to the public traveling from South Wicklow to 
Wexford.  It was agreed that the essential targeting of areas of economic 
importance in any future emergency was essential.

Europort, attended the meeting. 

In an address to the meeting Mr. Lynch stated that for reasons related to

referred to the retail and passenger facilities that were available to port users 
and outlined plans for re-furbishment of the terminal building and port 
infrastructure.  Mr. Lynch informed the meeting that over the past 22 years the

invested in the port from profits generated.  The Port Manager responded to a 
number of questions raised by the members on the use of sustainable energy 
in the port terminal, the re-location of the main station, the need to make the 
port more attractive for additional freight traffic, cruise liners and on the re-
investment of profit with €8m being spent on a roll on roll off berth within the 
past 2 years.  He outlined the necessity of improved access to the port 
through planned road schemes which would allow the port compete with 
Dublin and Bellview in Waterford.  Plans to deepen the berth in the port to 
9.2m would cost approximately €40-€50m. 

The Cathaoirleach Mr. Michael Kinsella thanked Mr. Lynch for attending and

Budget 2012: 

The draft budget for 2012 was circulated to the Members.  The County Manager advised 
the meeting that formalising the 2012 draft budget for consideration and adoption by the 
Members  had  been  a  very  difficult  task  in  these  financially  challenging  times  globally, 
nationally  and  locally.    He  outlined  how  the  finances  of  Wexford  County  Council  were 
severely  impacted  both  in  2010  and  2011  by  reduced  central  funding  accompanied  by 
reduced income from the Council’s own resources.  Since 2008 Wexford County Council 
had  seen  the  income  for  the  budget  reduced  from  €116.2m  to  €99.3m,  a  reduction  of 
14.5%.  He expected that there would be further reductions in the funding allocated from 
the  Local  Government  Fund  for  next  year  and  anticipated  a  6.8%  reduction  from  this 
funding  source  which  is  included  in  the  budget  resulting  in  a  reduced  income  of 
approximately €1.2m. 

In 2009 the Annual Roads Grant Allocation from the Department was reduced by €5.3m 
with  this  reduced  level  continuing  into  2010  and  2011  and  continues  to  have  a  huge 
impact on the Council’s ability to maintain and improve the road network in the county.  
The reduction in Road Grant Funding continues to place a strain on the Council’s ability 
to cover pay costs for its road crews and indications are that the funding situation may 
further deteriorate in 2012.  As Road Grant Allocations will not be announced until early 
in 2012 the budget anticipates that the 2011 grant level will be maintained but will need 
to be adjusted in line with grant allocations once details are announced.  Local funding 
for  roads  is  maintained  at  the  same  level  as  2011.    The  County  Manager  also 
commented  on  the  work  of  the  Local  Efficiency  Review  Group  comprising  of  staff 
representing  the  various  business  areas  of  the  Council  who  continue  to  examine  all

costs  of  the  business  areas  to  identify  and  implement  savings  and  efficiencies  where 
possible. 
income  base  of 
approximately €8m for 2012 poses a severe challenge for the Council.   

  The  constraints  of  reduced 

funding  with  reduced 

In  considering  the  budget  for  2012  the  Council  was  fully  aware  of  the  impact  of  Local 
Authority  charges  on  local  businesses  but  the  Council  is  obliged  once  again  to  seek  a 
balance to providing essential services with its role in promoting economic activity and 
development  in  the  county  while  also  acknowledging  the  financial  strains  facing  local 
businesses  and  householders.    In  acknowledgement  of  these  objectives  the  Council 
adopted  the  2010  and  2011  budgets  with  no  increase  in  rates,  water  services,  refuse 
collection  services  or  housing  rents.    The  2012  budget  also  proposes  to  hold  this 
position with no increase in commercial rates, no increase proposed in refuse charges, 
no  change  proposed  in  housing  rents,  no  increase  proposed  for  water/waste  water 
services.    The  continuance  of  these  policies  is  placing  an  additional  strain  on  the 
finances  of  the  County  Council  but  represents  the  Councils  commitment  to  minimising 
the  impact  of  reduced  central  funding  on  the  local  businesses  and  householders.    In 
conclusion the County Manager recommended the budget to the Council.  

The  Council  considered  the  detailed  proposals  of  the  budget  and  were  taken  through
